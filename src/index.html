                        '\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday took no responsibility for his part in fomenting a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol last week, despite his comments encouraging supporters to march on the Capitol and praise for them while they were still carrying out the assault.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” Trump said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He made the comments during his first appearance in public since the Capitol siege, which came as lawmakers were tallying Electoral College votes affirming President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Trump was heading to Texas on Tuesday to trumpet his campaign against illegal immigration in an attempt to burnish his legacy with eight days remaining in his term, as lawmakers in Congress appeared set to impeach him this week for the second time. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The rampage through the halls of Congress sent lawmakers of both parties and Trump\'s own vice president into hiding, as crowds called for Mike Pence\'s lynching for his role overseeing the vote count. The scene also undermined the hallmark of the republic — the peaceful transition of power. At least five people died, including one Capitol Police officer.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the days leading up to the Jan. 6 certification vote, Trump encouraged his supporters to descend on Washington, D.C., promising a “wild” rally in support of his baseless claims of election fraud, despite his own administration’s findings to the contrary. Speaking for more than an hour to a crowd on the Ellipse, Trump encouraged supporters to “fight like hell” and suggested that Republican lawmakers would need “more courage not to step up” and overturn the will of voters to grant him another term in office. He also suggested he would join them in marching on the Capitol.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\'7a5bbdf2c4c843db85d657c818fc6497\' class=\'media-placeholder\'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>As Trump wrapped up, thousands of his supporters were already heading to the Capitol, where lawmakers convened to count the electoral votes. As rioters were still in the building and lawmakers sheltered in secure locations, Trump, at the urging of aides who were shocked by the violence, released a video seemingly excusing the events, saying of the rioters: “We love you. You’re very special. Go home.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Speaking Tuesday, Trump said the “real problem” was not his rhetoric, but the rhetoric that Democrats used to describe Black Lives Matter protests and violence in Seattle and Portland this summer,\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Everybody to the ‘t’ thought it was totally appropriate,” Trump said of his own comments.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump was headed to Alamo, Texas, a city in the Rio Grande Valley near the U.S.-Mexican border — the site of the 450th mile of the border wall his administration is building. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="e92a99a0-2e30-11eb-83b0-d762284910b5">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Alamo is named after the San Antonio mission where a small group of Texan independence-fighters fended off Mexican forces during a 13-day siege. Most of them died, but the mission became a symbol of resistance for Texans, who eventually defeated the Mexican army.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump\'s visit — no doubt a symbol of the president\'s defiance — comes as he spends the final days of his presidency isolated, aggrieved and staring down the prospect of \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-cabinets-inaugurations-coronavirus-pandemic-9f815ffe1e847aaffdb6a4f9cd3d7ff2">a second impeachment. \u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>Aides have been urging the president to spend his remaining days in office highlighting what they see as the chief accomplishments of his presidency: a massive tax cut, his efforts to roll back federal regulations and the transformation of federal courts with the appointment of conservative judges. But Trump has repeatedly resisted their efforts as he has remained ensconced in the White House, behind closed doors, consumed by baseless allegations of voter fraud and conspiracies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump is expected to deliver remarks highlighting his administration\'s efforts to curb illegal immigration and the progress made on his signature 2016 campaign promise: building a “big, beautiful wall” across the length of the southern border — an imposing structure made of concrete and reinforced steel. Over time, Trump demanded modifications that have been largely rejected: He wanted it painted black to burn the hands of those who touched it; he wanted it adorned with deadly spikes; he even wanted to surround it with an alligator-filled moat. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In the end, his administration has overseen the construction of roughly 450 miles of border wall construction — likely reaching 475 miles by Inauguration Day. The vast majority of that wall replaces smaller barriers that had already existed, though the new wall is considerably more difficult to bypass.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A few dozen Trump supporters rallied hours before his visit to the Rio Grande Valley near the Harlingen, Texas, airport, where he was scheduled to land. They planned to stage a caravan of vehicles flying flags that support the president and far-right causes like the QAnon conspiracy theory.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Four people interviewed Tuesday morning all said they believed antifa and Black Lives Matter activists staged the Capitol riot, though federal authorities have uniformly identified far-right activists as responsible. Two people said they still believed Trump would be inaugurated for a second term next week, even after Congress certified Biden’s victory and courts at every level have dismissed Trump’s baseless claims of widespread voter fraud.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If he is able to see us, we hope that it would encourage him and lift up his spirits,” said Sharon Katie Taylor, a retiree from Iowa. “The people voted him in, and that will be proven.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9925853179">Full Coverage: Capitol siege\u003c/div>\u003cp>Over the last four years, Trump and his administration have taken extreme — and often unlawful — action to try to curb both illegal and legal immigration. Their efforts were aided in his final year by the coronavirus pandemic, which ground international travel to a halt. But the number of people stopped trying to cross the southern border illegally has been creeping back up in recent months. Figures from December show nearly 74,000 encounters at the southwest border, up 3% from November and up 81% from a year earlier. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has warned the next administration that easing Trump administration policies, including a halt to wall construction, would lead to a surge of people seeking to cross the border, creating "an unmitigated crisis in the first few weeks.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-foreign-policy-delaware-wilmington-1149b07b899e0bb9b50b30348f0983d8">has said he’d halt\u003c/a> construction of the border wall and take executive action where possible to reverse some of Trump’s restrictions on legal immigration and asylum seekers. But Biden and his aides have acknowledged the possibility of a new crisis at the border if they act too quickly, and Biden has said it could take six months for his administration to secure funding and put in place the necessary infrastructure to loosen Trump-era restrictions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After the Capitol violence, groups including the Southern Poverty Law Center urged Trump to call off his visit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The violence Trump incited last week, and the violence his anti-immigrant policies cause stem from the alarming mainstreaming of white nationalist ideology that our country must reckon with and fight to uproot," said Efrén Olivares, deputy legal director of the center’s Immigrant Justice Project. “The president’s planned trip to the border will only further the harm and beget more violence."\u003c/p>\u003cp>___ Associated Press writers Nooman Merchant in Harlingen, Texas; Ben Fox and Alexandra Jaffe in Washington; and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\u003c/p>',

David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Ted Lieu of California, Raskin of Maryland and Jerrold Nadler of New York draws from Trump\'s own false statements about his election defeat to Biden. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Judges across the country, including some nominated by Trump, have repeatedly dismissed cases challenging the election results, and former Attorney General William Barr, a Trump ally, has said there was no sign of widespread fraud. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The impeachment legislation also details Trump\'s pressure on state officials in Georgia to “find” him more votes, as well as his White House rally ahead of the Capitol siege, in which he encouraged thousands of supporters last Wednesday to “fight like hell” and march to the building.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The mob overpowered police, broke through security lines and windows and rampaged through the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to scatter as they were finalizing Biden’s victory over Trump in the Electoral College. \u003c/p>\u003cp>While some have questioned impeaching the president so close to the end of his term, Democrats and others argue he must be prevented from holding future public office. \u003c/p>\u003cp>There is precedent for pursuing impeachment after an official leaves office. In 1876, during the Ulysses Grant administration, War Secretary William Belknap was impeached by the House the day he resigned, and the Senate convened a trial months later. He was acquitted.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Barrow reported from Wilmington, Delaware.

                        '\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — Barely a month into a mass vaccination campaign to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration unexpectedly shifted gears Tuesday to speed the delivery of shots. The move came after widespread concern over a slow start even as coronavirus cases and deaths reach new highs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced a series of major changes to increase supply of vaccines and expand the age groups eligible as well as locations where people can get shots.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One change will have some teeth to it. Azar said going forward the federal government will base each state\'s allocation of vaccines partly on how successful states have been in administering those already provided.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“If you are not using vaccines that you have the right to, then we should be rebalancing to states that are using that vaccine," Azar said at news conference. That won\'t happen overnight, not until officials try to sort out whether lags in reporting could be the reason for what appears to be subpar performance.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Azar also said the government will stop holding back the required second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, practically doubling supply. Both those shots require two doses to achieve optimum protection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Additionally, Washington is urging states to immediately start vaccinating other groups lower down the priority scale, including people age 65 and older and younger people with certain health problems. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="74fbdad0-2e30-11eb-e940-db0f7b1861c8">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The move to increase the supply of vaccines better aligns the outgoing administration with the new Biden-Harris team. On Friday, \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-ap-top-news-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-f7bb372f73a4f204ec540d39a4409e18">President-elect Joe Biden said he will rapidly release most available vaccine doses\u003c/a> to protect more people. He said he supported immediately releasing vaccines that health authorities were holding back out of caution, to guarantee they would be available for people needing their second dose.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This next phase reflects the urgency of the situation,” said Azar. “Every vaccine dose sitting in a warehouse rather than going into an arm could mean one more death that could have been avoided."\u003c/p>\u003cp>Initially the government had been holding back second doses as a safety precaution against potential shortfalls in production. Now, officials say they are confident the needed supply will be there. And people needing a second dose will have priority.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Simultaneously, Azar gave states the green light to provide more places where people can get shots. Those locations can include tens of thousands of pharmacies, federally supported community health centers that serve low-income communities, and mass vaccination sites already being set up in some states.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As of Monday morning, the government had distributed about 25.5 million doses to states, U.S. territories and major cities. But only about 9 million people had received their first shot, \u003ca href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s online tracker.\u003c/a> That means only about 35% of the available vaccines had been administered.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Initially, the shots were going to health care workers and nursing home residents. Those 75 and older were next in line. \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-vaccine-rollout-us-f1c942e2d3d23cfd4fca571426154a42">But problems arose even in vaccinating that limited pool of people.\u003c/a> Some hospital and nursing home workers have been hesitant to get the vaccine. Scheduling issues created delays in getting shots to nursing homes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some states, including Arizona, have or are planning to open up \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/mlb-michigan-coronavirus-pandemic-gretchen-whitmer-c9be214795c5a12a1b1ba505d856c048"> mass vaccination centers\u003c/a>, aiming to inoculate thousands of people a day in a single location. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis opened up vaccinations to people 65 and older. In other states, local health authorities have started asking residents 65 and older to register, in anticipation the vaccination campaign would be expanded.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Although Azar said the shift in strategy was a natural evolution of the Trump administration\'s efforts, as recently as Friday he had raised questions about whether Biden\'s call to accelerate supplies was prudent. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Tuesday, he also sought to deflect blame to the states for the slow uptake of vaccines. Azar said some states are being “overly prescriptive and trying to micromanage every single dose of vaccine,” leading to bottlenecks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Azar also criticized what he called “the hospitalization of vaccine distribution,” saying “we have too much vaccine sitting in freezers in hospitals.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>State and local officials are sure to point out that it was the federal government that recommended putting health care workers at the front of the vaccination line.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Trump administration directed a crash effort to develop, manufacture and deliver vaccines, hoping to avoid a repeat of earlier debacles with coronavirus testing. Dubbed “Operation Warp Speed,” it has produced two highly effective vaccines, with more on the way.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Each state has its own plan for who should be vaccinated, based on CDC recommendations that gave first priority to health care workers and nursing home residents. Some critics say the administration\'s planning should have extended into helping states administer the shots after they were delivered. Congress has recently approved more than $8 billion for that.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The slow pace of the vaccine rollout has frustrated many Americans at a time when the coronavirus death toll has continued to rise. More than 376,000 people in the U.S. have died, according to the Johns Hopkins database.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9902935380">Full Coverage: Coronavirus vaccine\u003c/div>\u003cp>Azar said the pace of vaccinations has picked up, hitting 700,000 a day recently and on track to reach 1 million daily. But the American Hospital Association estimates 1.8 million vaccinations a day are needed, seven days a week, to achieve widespread immunity by the middle of this year. Biden has set a goal of 100 million shots administered in his first 100 days.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re in a race against this virus and quite frankly, we’re behind,” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams told “Fox &amp; Friends.” Public health advocates agree.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Bottom line is we need to get the most vaccine in the most arms as quickly as we can and we need to make sure people get the second dose — those are not necessarily at odds with each other,” said Chrissie Juliano, of the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents leaders of large metropolitan health departments. “The public health prevention measures we are asking people to do — stay home, mask up, social distance — aren’t getting us to where we need to be. We need to be bold and we need to respond with renewed urgency.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden is expected to give a speech Thursday outlining his plan to speed vaccines to more people in the first part of his administration. His transition team has vowed to release as many vaccine doses as possible, rather than continuing what had been the Trump administration policy of holding back millions of doses to ensure there would be enough supply to allow those getting the first shot to get a second one.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Azar said they\'ll brief the Biden transition team on the changes, but didn\'t seek their blessing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writers Candice Choi in New York, Carole Feldman in Washington, and Michelle R.

Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, was given the authority to tap up to 15,000 Guard, but he has said that requests for assistance from the Secret Service, the U.S. Park Police and the Capitol Police have been increasing this week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Army also said Tuesday that officials are working with the Secret Service to determine which Guard members may need additional background screening.

Trump, for months, had also spread baseless claims that the November election was fraudulent, despite his own administration’s findings to the contrary.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As rioters were still in the Capitol, Trump released a video seemingly excusing the events, saying of the rioters: “We love you.

                        '\u003cp>TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) — A judge has temporarily stopped the U.S. government’s plans Tuesday to carry out the first federal execution of a female inmate in nearly seven decades, finding that the Kansas woman who killed an expectant mother, cut the baby from her womb and tried to pass off the newborn as her own was likely mentally ill and couldn’t comprehend she would be put to death.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When other executions by the Trump administration were similarly stayed in days or even hours before the scheduled execution times last year, the Department of Justice succeeded in getting a higher court to reverse them. Government lawyers also quickly appealed the stay issued Monday for Lisa Montgomery. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Montgomery was convicted of \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-michael-brown-coronavirus-pandemic-executions-terre-haute-ef212a64d7f6d8da9ff9f0a2ac3e3390">killing 23-year-old Bobbie Jo Stinnett \u003c/a> in the northwest Missouri town of Skidmore in 2004. She used a rope to strangle Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant, and then cut the baby girl from the womb with a kitchen knife. Montgomery took the child with her and attempted to pass the girl off as her own.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A federal judge in southwestern Indiana handed down the order Monday less than 24 hours before the 52-year-old Montgomery, the only female on federal death row, was set to be executed at a federal prison complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Any delay of Montgomery’s execution beyond Joe Biden’s inauguration next Tuesday would likely mean she will not be executed since a Biden administration is expected to oppose carrying out of federal death sentences. \u003c/p>\u003cp>One of Montgomery’s lawyers, Kelley Henry, told The Associated Press Tuesday morning that her client arrived at the Terre Haute facility late Monday night from a Texas prison and that, because there are no facilities for female inmates, she was being kept in a cell in the execution-chamber building itself. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don’t believe she has any rational comprehension of what’s going on at all,” Henry said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Montgomery has done needle-point in prison, making gloves, hats and other knitted items as gifts for her lawyers and others, Henry said. She hasn’t been able to continue that hobby or read since her glasses were taken away from her out of concern she could commit suicide. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“All of her coping mechanisms were taken away from her when they locked her down” in October when she was informed she had an execution date, Henry said. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Montgomery’s legal team says she suffered “sexual torture,” including gang rapes, as a child, permanently scarring her emotionally and exacerbating mental-health issues that ran in her family. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At trial, prosecutors accused Montgomery of faking mental illness, noting that her killing of Stinnett was premeditated and included meticulous planning, including online research on how to perform a C-section. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Henry balked at that idea, citing extensive testing and brain scans that supported the diagnosis of mental illness. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“You can’t fake brain scans that show the brain damage,” she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Henry said the issue at the core of the legal arguments are not whether she knew the killing was wrong in 2004 but whether she fully grasps why she is slated to be executed now. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In his ruling on a stay, U.S. District Judge James Patrick Hanlon in Terre Haute cited defense experts who alleged Montgomery suffered from depression, borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Montgomery, the judge wrote, also suffered around the time of the killing from an extremely rare condition called pseudocyesis in which a woman’s false belief she is pregnant triggers hormonal and physical changes as if she was actually pregnant. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Montgomery also experiences delusions and hallucinations, believing God spoke with her through connect-the-dot puzzles, the judge said, citing defense experts. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The record before the Court contains ample evidence that Ms. Montgomery’s current mental state is so divorced from reality that she cannot rationally understand the government’s rationale for her execution,” the judge’ said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The government has acknowledged Montgomery’s mental issues but disputes that she can’t comprehend that she is scheduled for execution for killing another person because of them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Details of the crime at times left jurors in tears during her trial.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Prosecutors told the jury Montgomery drove about 170 miles (274 kilometers) from her Melvern, Kansas, farmhouse to the northwest Missouri town of Skidmore under the guise of adopting a rat terrier puppy from Stinnett. She strangled Stinnett performing a crude cesarean and fleeing with the baby.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Prosecutors said Stinnett regained consciousness and tried to defend herself as Montgomery used a kitchen knife to cut the baby girl from her womb. Later that day, Montgomery called her husband to pick her up in the parking lot of a Long John Silver’s in Topeka, Kansas, telling him she had delivered the baby earlier in the day at a nearby birthing center.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Montgomery was arrested the next day after showing off the premature infant, Victoria Jo, who is now 16 years old and hasn’t spoken publicly about the tragedy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Prosecutors said the motive was that Montgomery’s ex-husband knew she had undergone a tubal ligation that made her sterile and planned to reveal she was lying about being pregnant in an effort to get custody of two of their four children. Needing a baby before a fast-approaching court date, Montgomery turned her focus on Stinnett, whom she had met at dog shows.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. has executed \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-coronavirus-pandemic-executions-736b68c22e821be7c5faa85f1bf0b245">10 people at Terre Haute\u003c/a> since the resumption of federal executions after a 17-year pause started on July 14.

                        '\u003cp>LAS VEGAS (AP) — Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire mogul, Republican mega-donor and power broker who built a casino empire spanning from Las Vegas to China and became a singular force in domestic and international politics, has died after a long illness. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson died at 87 from complications related to treatment for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Las Vegas Sands announced Tuesday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He was the son of Jewish immigrants raised in a Boston tenement who became one of the world’s richest men. The chairman and CEO of the Las Vegas Sands brought singing gondoliers to the Vegas Strip and foresaw the same potential in Asia. Forbes ranked him No. 19 in the U.S., worth an estimated $29.8 billion.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“If you do things differently, success will follow you like a shadow,” he said during a 2014 talk to the gambling industry in Las Vegas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Blunt yet secretive, the squatly-built Adelson resembled an old-fashioned political boss. He became one of the nation’s most influential GOP donors by setting records for individual contributions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2012, Politico called him “the dominant pioneer of the super PAC era.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson hosted the party’s top strategists and candidates at his modest office wedged among the casinos of the Las Vegas Strip. He helped ensure that uncritical support of Israel became a pillar of the GOP platform, never more visibly than when the Trump administration relocated the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The inflammatory move had been adamantly opposed by Palestinians and was long a priority for Adelson, who sat front and center at the ceremony in Jerusalem. with his wife, Miriam.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More recently, he reportedly purchased the U.S. ambassador’s official residence near Tel Aviv for some $67 million in a maneuver that appeared be aimed at preventing the embassy from relocating back to Tel Aviv after Trump leaves office. Just weeks ago, Adelson provided a private plane for Jonathan Pollard, a former U.S. intelligence analyst who spent 30 years in prison for spying for Israel, to move to Israel after his parole ended.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="db712c40-2e30-11eb-e0d8-c3209b64f6fc">\u003c/div>\u003cp>When asked at a gambling conference what he hoped his legacy would be, Adelson said it wasn’t his glitzy casinos or hotels but his impact in Israel. He was closely aligned with the conservative Likud party and funded a widely-read free daily newspaper called “Israel Hayom,” or “Israel Today,” so supportive of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that some Israelis nicknamed it “Bibi-ton,” a play on words combining Netanyahu\'s nickname with the Hebrew word for newspaper. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In the U.S., Adelson helped underwrite congressional trips to Israel, helped build a new headquarters for the lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and later was a top supporter of the Israeli-American Council, whose conferences have attracted top Republicans (Vice President Mike Pence) and Democrats (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi).\u003c/p>\u003cp>His attachment to Israel was life-long and so deep that he once said he wished his military service had been in an Israeli uniform instead of an American one.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/sheldon-adelson-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-9e6fb531f3ac4f52a16e0d12bad5f833">said Tuesday\u003c/a> that Adelson “will forever be remembered” for his work strengthening ties between the U.S. and Israel.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson was a late bloomer in business and in politics. He didn’t become a casino owner, or a Republican, until well into middle age. Through the 1990s and after his wealth soared, his engagement in politics intensified. He was a supporter of President George W. Bush and backed Republican Rudolph Giuliani for the 2008 presidential race, before turning to the eventual candidate, Sen. John McCain, who lost to Barack Obama.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Sheldon battled his way out of a tough Boston neighborhood to build a successful enterprise that loyally employed tens of thousands - and entertained millions," said Bush in a prepared statement Tuesday. “He was an American patriot.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson\'s leverage grew considerably in 2010 after the Supreme Court’s “Citizens United” decision lifted many restrictions on individual campaign contributions. He and his wife spent more than $90 million on the 2012 election, funding presidential candidate Newt Gingrich and later Mitt Romney.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m against very wealthy people attempting to or influencing elections,” he told Forbes magazine in 2012. “But as long as it’s doable I’m going to do it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson came around slowly to Trump, who ridiculed Adelson\'s support for Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, tweeting in 2015, “Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!” \u003c/p>\u003cp>But after Trump’s surprise victory, the new president spoke often with Adelson and embraced his hardline views on the Middle East. He cut funding for Palestinian refugees and withdrew from the Obama administration’s nuclear nonproliferation deal with Iran. He bucked long-held and bipartisan U.S. policy that viewed Jerusalem as key to any peace agreement with the Palestinians. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson, in turn, aided Trump financially, including $5 million for his inauguration, and supported him through his media holdings. Late in 2015, Adelson secretly purchased the Las Vegas Review-Journal — the paper’s own reporters revealed he was the new owner. Some longtime staffers left in protest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In what was widely seen as a mark of the Adelsons’ influence with Trump, Miriam Adelson was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9894828501">Full Coverage: Sheldon Adelson\u003c/div>\u003cp>Adelson, who contributed more than $100 million to the 2018 off-year elections, held extraordinary power among Republicans even though he didn’t always agree with them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our nation lost a remarkable American with the passing of my friend Sheldon Adelson," said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In a 2012 interview with The Wall Street Journal, he called himself “basically a social liberal,” who was pro-choice on abortion and supportive of immigrant rights. He cited taxes and differences over Israel as major reasons for leaving the Democratic party.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“His life made him a fearless advocate for freedom and entrepreneurship and a source of counsel and support to a generation of conservatives, including me,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Nevada, his influence was such that even the state’s most prominent Democrat, Sen. Harry Reid, hesitated to take him on. In a 2014 interview with MSNBC, the then-Senate majority leader differentiated between Adelson and fellow GOP billionaire donors Charles and David Koch. Reid had sharply criticized the Koch brothers as callous and greedy, while saying that he respected Adelson because he was “not in it to make money,” a widely challenged opinion. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“In the nearly four decades that I’ve known him, Sheldon Adelson has been outspoken with causes important to him," Reid said Tuesday. “His advocacy for the state of Israel and Jewish causes was without equal and made a difference in countless lives both at home and abroad.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson was married twice. He and his first wife, Sandra, were divorced in 1988. Three years later, he married Miriam Farbstein-Ochshorn, an Israeli-born doctor he met on a blind date and whom many believe helped deepen his involvement with Israel. Their honeymoon trip to Venice inspired Adelson to raze the historic Sands hotel-casino, once a favorite hangout for Frank Sinatra among others, and replaced it with a pair of massive complexes: The Venetian and The Palazzo, one of the city’s tallest buildings.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson led efforts to move the NFL Raiders team from Oakland, California, to Las Vegas and his decision during pandemic to keep his casino employees in Las Vegas paid and insured despite closures and business slowing for casinos. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“That commitment helped keep thousands of Nevadans afloat during the most difficult of months, and Sheldon’s commitment will never be forgotten,” said Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sheldon Adelson adopted his first wife’s three children and had two children with his second wife. Among numerous philanthropic projects, he and Miriam Adelson were especially committed to the research and treatment of substance abuse, a personal cause for Sheldon Adelson. His son Mitchell, from his first marriage, died of an overdose in 2005. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sheldon Garry Adelson was born in 1933, in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. His father was a taxi driver, his mother the manager of a knitting store. A natural entrepreneur, he was selling newspapers by age 12 and running a vending machine business at 16. After dropping out of City College of New York and serving in the Army, he attempted to start dozens of small businesses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson, who said he disdained email, began to amass his fortune with a technology trade show, starting computer convention COMDEX in 1979 before selling his stake in 1995 for more than $800 million. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When he bought the Sands Hotel in 1989, he was thinking convention space, not just gambling, would make money. It did. He built a convention hall to keep his hotel rooms full on weekdays and others soon followed the business model. Meanwhile, he worked to replicate the Strip in Macao, the only place in China where casino gambling is legal, and his wealth grew exponentially.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When faced with water and marsh land, Adelson directed his company to build land where there wasn’t any, piling sand up to create the Cotai Peninsula. Soon his Macao revenue outstripped that of his Las Vegas holdings. He later expanded his business to Singapore, where his Marina Bay Sands hotel and its infinity pool were featured in the film “Crazy Rich Asians,” and had been pressing to open a casino in Japan.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His Macao business also spawned a long-running wrongful termination lawsuit brought by a former chief of Sands China Ltd. who accused Adelson and the company of firing him for exposing a host of misdeeds. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Sands China lawsuit was among dozens involving Adelson, whose cases included his suing a Wall Street Journal reporter for calling him “foul-mouthed” (the parties settled, the words remained) to being sued by his sons from his first marriage for cheating them out of money (he won).\u003c/p>\u003cp>A long-running feud with fellow casino tycoon Steve Wynn turned to friendship when Wynn joined Adelson’s effort to end online gambling. Critics said Adelson was trying to stifle competition. Adelson countered that there was no way to ensure children and teenagers wouldn’t gamble and said he was “not in favor of it exploiting the world’s most vulnerable people.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump’s election would again prove useful to Adelson. During the Obama administration, the Justice Department said online gambling that does not involve sporting events would not violate the Wire Act, a 1961 federal statute. In a legal opinion that became public early in 2019, the department reversed itself and decided the statute applies to any form of gambling.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writers Michelle L. Price and Ken Ritter in Las Vegas, Zeke Miller and Alan Fram in Washington, Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report. \u003c/p>',

                        '\u003cp>TULUM, Mexico (AP) — The friends from Jackson, Mississippi, relaxed on lounge chairs dug into a white sand beach and romped in the turquoise Caribbean waters, grateful for a break from the pandemic winter in the United States.\u003c/p>\u003cp>They were among tens of thousands of American tourists who descended on Mexico\'s glittering Caribbean beaches at the close of 2020 and start of this year. Quintana Roo state, the country’s tourism crown jewel, home to Cancun, the Riviera Maya and Tulum, received 961,000 tourists during that stretch — nearly half from the U.S. — down only 25% from the previous year. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“You come here and it’s a sigh of relief from all the turmoil of the COVID,” said Latron Evans, a 40-year-old Jackson firefighter.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="e8a231959855464398142f26f0f41346">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="1171ebf67206465598a79ac543b854bb">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="9b5467fa13e7426c8f2ce719af8f13be">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But concern is spreading that the winter holiday success could be fleeting, because it came as COVID-19 infections in both Mexico and the United States, the main source of the foreign tourists, were reaching new heights — and as a new, more easily spread variant was beginning to emerge in the U.S. If a sharp rise in infections forces a new shutdown of the tourism sector, the effects would be devastating. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Tourism accounts for 87% of Quintana Roo’s gross domestic product, said state Tourism Secretary Marisol Vanegas Pérez. The state lost some 90,000 tourism jobs — only 10,000 of which have come back — and countless others that depend on tourism. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Flights from the U.S. dried up last spring as the pandemic took hold but have risen steadily since then. In December, Quintana Roo was averaging 460 air arrivals and departures per day compared to a pre-pandemic average of 500, Vanegas said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9906521625">Full Coverage: Photography\u003c/div>\u003cp>The increase in American tourists helped compensate for the Europeans, whose numbers remain sharply down. More U.S. tourists came to Quintana Roo during this pandemic-stricken holiday season than a year earlier, when the world was just beginning to learn of the coronavirus. They accounted for 9 out of 10 foreign tourists, Vanegas said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And they are staying longer, with some seemingly waiting out the pandemic at the beach, she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Officials strive to “create a tourist bubble that generates confidence in everything a tourist does,” Vanegas said, describing how the visitors move from the airport to a van to a hotel, and then to tours of sun-splashed archaeological sites certified by state health authorities. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Where there could be risk is when they leave that bubble,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For example, the throbbing crowd that packed shoulder-to-shoulder — many not wearing masks — in downtown streets and clubs to ring in the New Year in Playa del Carmen, the lively beach town between Cancun and Tulum. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="eae5aea3f77848c3ab6a42ae17d95716">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="c2674195817249f9b3d123641843427b">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="bdcde89c9ead4fae970416223b694228">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="4f8011f5b70e40ff8fdf35704fdc6aac">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Indoor venues also pose a risk: Restaurants, theaters, salons and other businesses are permitted to operate at 60% capacity, and indoor gyms at 50%. Hotels can book at 70% capacity. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Evans, the Mississippi firefighter, said he was impressed by the health measures everywhere he went. “They’re taking temperatures when you enter the building and giving you hand sanitizer every place you go," he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>His friend, Gearald Green, a 32-year-old music producer from Jackson, where nearly everyone in his immediate circle of friends has been infected, said the climate and outdoor-focused beach living inspired confidence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don’t have to try an extra amount to keep social distance because it’s the beach, it’s water and when you come out it’s not like a lot of people on top of one another," he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Vanegas said the state health department aggressively traces any reported infections. Still, there are worrisome signs. The positivity rate on COVID-19 tests in the state is nearly 50% and the weekly number of COVID-19 deaths quadrupled from the week before Christmas to the week after, according to federal government data.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Health experts fear the increase in travel through the holiday season will likely lead to spikes in places that previously seemed to have it under control.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In the most popular tourist destinations, you’re going to have epidemic activity increase again in a big way,” said Dr. Mauricio Rodríguez of the medical school at Mexico’s National Autonomous University, citing beach destinations like Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco, Quintana Roo and the Riviera Maya.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="9e9b0b8f496c4934a09002cd4966594f">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="4f6071d1b664401c982bf7b40a452eec">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The southern state of Oaxaca, which draws tourists to its colonial capital as well as its laid-back Pacific beaches, had half the number of tourists this holiday season as a year earlier. State Tourism Secretary Juan Carlos Rivera said that wasn’t bad considering the pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are going to enter in ... an economic recession in terms of tourism in the coming months, not only in Oaxaca, in the whole country,” Rivera said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>If infections increase sharply, pressure will build to close beaches again like last spring, spurring massive layoffs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When the pandemic arrived in Mexico, big hotels started laying off workers with what they called “solidarity breaks.” Workers were told it was temporary, that they’d be hired back in a month and most were let go without the benefits they deserved.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There was little debate over the health risks of promoting tourism versus the economic impact of losing all those jobs, said Alejandro Palafox-Muñoz, a professor of tourism at the University of Quintana Roo. The people who lost those jobs had no choice but to go out and look for new work to feed their families, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Saily Camacho, 25, had worked at a beach club on the island of Cozumel for two years, as a hostess, selling tours and at the cash register. Barely two weeks after the first recorded COVID-19 infection in Mexico, she was out of a job. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Camacho earned commissions from selling tours and could make $110 on a good day. After she was laid off, she lived off her savings for a month, thinking that she’d be hired back. She put finishing her college degree on hold. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Her mother and two siblings lost their tourism sector jobs too. Her mother — and many others — tried to sustain themselves by selling food from their homes via social networks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Her mother, a hotel chambermaid, finally started a new hotel job this month. After a long search, Camacho was hired as a cashier at a supermarket where it takes her almost two weeks to earn what she made on a good day at the beach club.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Before, I was working to save for my future, to buy a house, a car," Camacho said. “And now, honestly, I only work to get by, for food, for expenses.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>She still has concerns about the coronavirus, but admitted that she was buoyed by seeing tourists return. “To see tourists, truly, was something exciting, because it’s the sustenance for the island,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="749f5d026a7a44a589ba10fe17742fba">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="e4223e4dd4a34bbc880c5e17fb6c7537">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="86fb8e5597174feca880237817a8df27">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="eb351c45122e4b4ebb9a79c9bc9be01f">\u003c/div>\u003cp>__\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sherman reported from Mexico City.

                        '\u003cp>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — Fallout from the coronavirus pandemic is threatening a company’s plans to retrieve and exhibit the radio that had broadcast distress calls from the sinking Titanic, according to a court filing made by the firm. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The company, RMS Titanic Inc., said Monday that its revenues plummeted after coronavirus restrictions closed its exhibits of Titanic artifacts, causing the firm to seek funding through its parent company. Some of the exhibitions, which are scattered across the country, are still closed, while others that have reopened are seeing limited attendance.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>RMS Titanic Inc. recently missed a deadline with a federal admiralty court in Virginia to submit a funding plan for the radio expedition. The company left open the possibility that it may no longer seek the court’s approval for the undertaking if a plan isn’t submitted in the coming weeks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The company’s update, filed with a U.S. District Court in Norfolk, was made in the midst of an ongoing court battle with the United States over whether the expedition is legal.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lawyers for the U.S. government have \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/d15d5490c084574acb45cb6794bc937e">argued\u003c/a> that the mission is barred under federal law and an international agreement with Britain. The attorneys say the company must seek the government\'s permission to remove the radio because the sunken vessel is a recognized memorial to the roughly 1,500 people who died.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The luxury ocean liner was traveling from England to New York in 1912 when it struck an iceberg and sank. It was \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/cf4d66e7517f69b62fb699e5ddab19b8">discovered\u003c/a> in 1985 about 2.4 miles (3.8 kilometers) below the surface of the North Atlantic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>RMS Titanic Inc. owns the salvage rights and oversees a collection of items recovered from the wreck as the court-recognized steward of the artifacts. They include silverware, china and gold coins as well as the Titanic’s whistles and a piece of its hull.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Exhibiting the radio will help sustain the ship’s legacy while honoring passengers and crew, the company has \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/bf04ef5b86a23e23adfaf867ae5ce9c5">argued\u003c/a>. Known in 1912 as a Marconi wireless telegraph machine, the radio sent distress calls to nearby ships that helped save 700 people in lifeboats.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. government\'s effort to stop the expedition is pending in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond. But the company’s funding woes appear to pose a more immediate threat.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“The pandemic and resulting governmental restrictions forced the company to temporarily close its exhibitions to the public, effectively shutting off its primary source of revenue for six months,” RMS Titanic Inc. wrote in Monday’s filing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Atlanta-based company said only a few of its exhibits, including one in Las Vegas and another in Orlando, have reopened. They\'re operating at diminished capacity and revenues "remain very low."\u003c/p>\u003cp>The company said it received more than $700,000 through the Paycheck Protection Program. And it expects to get $3 million in funding through its parent company, Premier Acquisition Holdings, LLC.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A federal admiralty judge in Norfolk had \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/879f8b7752bc005cab0eea2676780876">approved\u003c/a> the planned expedition in May. But the approval was conditioned on the firm submitting a plan detailing costs and funding for the operation and conservation of the recovered equipment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>RMS Titanic said in Monday\'s filing that it\'s still trying to finalize that plan despite missing a Jan. 10 deadline. It said the plan “will depend on a complicated, multi-faceted commercial transaction between RMST, an international production company, and deep-sea salvage experts."\u003c/p>\u003cp>The company said it hopes to submit a plan by Jan. 29. But if it\'s unable to, the firm said it would withdraw its original motion seeking the court\'s permission to retrieve the radio.\u003c/p>',

The newspaper reported that the document detailed posts calling for violence, including that “Congress needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in, and blood from their BLM and Antifa slave soldiers being spilled.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>It also said to “go there ready for war.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Associated Press has not obtained the document.

The House is set to impeach Trump this week on a sole charge of inciting insurrection in the violent riot. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Schumer wants the chamber to swiftly take up those nominees for secretary of defense, secretary of homeland security, secretary of state, attorney general, and others.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Schumer outlined the party’s agenda, vowing to push ahead on Democratic priorities.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE FALLOUT FROM THE RIOTING AT THE CAPITOL:\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ahead of impeachment, the House is speeding ahead to oust President Donald Trump from office, warning he is a threat to democracy and pushing the vice president and Cabinet to act first in an extraordinary effort to remove Trump in the final days of his presidency.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Read more:\u003c/p>\u003cp>— House speeding \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-cabinets-inaugurations-coronavirus-pandemic-9f815ffe1e847aaffdb6a4f9cd3d7ff2">to impeach Trump\u003c/a> for Capitol ‘insurrection’\u003c/p>\u003cp>—Analysis: Trump \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-donald-trump-politics-coronavirus-pandemic-capitol-siege-e6111a8fe1c04605f3efd8d271fec0c0">abdicating in the job \u003c/a> he fought to keep\u003c/p>\u003cp>— \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/fbi-warns-armed-protests-next-week-ec75b26289166b4afd30c15b0dd2ded5">FBI warns\u003c/a> of plans for nationwide armed protests next week\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON:\u003c/p>\u003cp>11:50 a.m.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A total of 15,000 National Guard members have now been activated and will deploy to Washington, D.C., to help provide security in the run up to the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The number of Guard members coming in from other states has been growing, amid escalating fears of more violent protests in the wake of the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, was given the authority to tap up to 15,000 Guard, but he has said that requests for assistance from the Secret Service, the U.S. Park Police and the Capitol Police have been increasing this week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Army also said Tuesday that officials are working with the Secret Service to determine which Guard members may need additional background screening. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Co., had asked Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to have the Army’s Criminal Investigation Command screen Guard members coming in to ensure they were not “sympathetic to domestic terrorists.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Army said CID will not be reviewing all the Guard, but some members may be subject to additional background screening. Traditionally, those who get within close proximity to the president -- or in this case the president-elect — are checked more closely.\u003c/p>\u003cp>So far, officials said they have not yet identified any Guard members who participated in the protests, but investigations are ongoing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a statement, the Army said the D.C. National Guard is also giving troops additional training as they arrive in the city, so they know to identify and report any extremist behavior to their commanders.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Army also said it is working with the FBI to identify people who participated in Capitol attack, adding, “any type of activity that involves violence, civil disobedience, or a breach of peace may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or under state or federal law.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>11:15 a.m.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is calling on the FBI to add anyone identified breaching the Capitol during last week’s violent riot to the federal no-fly list.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Schumer sent a letter Tuesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, saying the attack on the Capitol as Congress was voting to affirm President-elect Joe Biden’s win was “domestic terrorism.” He said those who stormed the Capitol should qualify as “insurrectionists for the No-Fly List.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Schumer told Wray that they must also be fully prosecuted to the full extent of federal law. The letter was obtained by The Associated Press.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The federal no-fly list is part of the U.S. government’s Terrorist Screening Database and prohibits anyone who “may pose a threat to civil aviation or national security” from boarding a commercial aircraft. Generally, in order to be placed on the list, the government must have information that the person presents “a threat of committing terrorism” to the aircraft or the U.S. homeland or U.S. facilities. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The no-fly list is one of the government’s most controversial post-Sept. 11 counterterrorism programs. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___ \u003c/p>\u003cp>10:55 a.m.\u003c/p>\u003cp>President Donald Trump is taking no responsibility for his role in fomenting a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A Capitol police officer died from injuries suffered in the riot, and police shot a woman during the violence. Three others died in what authorities said were medical emergencies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Speaking to reporters before traveling to Texas on Tuesday, Trump says his remarks to supporters last week were “totally appropriate.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Minutes before his supporters stormed the Capitol, Trump encouraged them to march on the seat of the nation’s government where lawmakers were tallying Electoral College votes affirming President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Trump, for months, had also spread baseless claims that the November election was fraudulent, despite his own administration’s findings to the contrary.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As rioters were still in the Capitol, Trump released a video seemingly excusing the events, saying of the rioters: “We love you. You’re very special.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>10:30 a.m.\u003c/p>\u003cp>President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday at the White House that the prospect of impeachment is causing “tremendous anger” in the nation. But he said he wants “no violence.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president spoke as he left for Texas to survey the border wall with Mexico. His remarks were his first to reporters since the Capitol attack.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On impeachment, Trump said it’s “a really terrible thing that they’re doing.” But he said, “We want no violence. Never violence.”\u003c/p>',

                            '\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. House pressed swiftly forward Tuesday toward impeachment or other steps to forcibly remove President Donald Trump from office, even as Trump blamed Democratic foes and not himself for last week\'s deadly attack on the Capitol.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He targeted the lawmakers who are pushing for his ouster, saying that it\'s “a really terrible thing that they’re doing.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“To continue on this path, I think it’s causing tremendous danger to our country, and it’s causing tremendous anger," he said. He accepted no blame for the Capitol attack and said, “I want no violence.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The defeated president, in his first remarks to reporters since last week’s violence, showed no remorse for firing up the crowd ahead of the the deadly invasion with comments that now are part of the impeachment charge of inciting insurrection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president spoke as he left for Texas to survey the border wall with Mexico, taking no questions, after the most serious and deadly domestic incursion at the Capitol in the nation’s history.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Impeachment ahead, the House on Tuesday will first try to convince the vice president and Cabinet to act even more quickly to remove Trump from office, warning he is a threat to democracy in the remaining days of his presidency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>House lawmakers are reconvening at the Capitol for the first time since the deadly pro-Trump riot to approve a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare the president unable to serve. Pence is not expected to take any such action. The House would next move swiftly to impeach Trump.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\'c1d0150957dc47aebc83fb67b4e8a78c\' class=\'media-placeholder\'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“We have to be very tough and very strong right now in defending the Constitution and democracy,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., an author of both pieces of legislation, in an interview.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump faces a single charge — “incitement of insurrection” — in the \u003ca href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7347691-Articles-of-impeachment-against-President-Trump.html">impeachment resolution\u003c/a> that the House will begin debating Wednesday, a week before Democrat Joe Biden is set to be inaugurated, Jan. 20. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The unprecedented events, only the first U.S. president to be twice impeached, are unfolding in a nation bracing for more unrest. The FBI has \u003ca>warned ominously of potential armed protests\u003c/a> in Washington and \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/state-capitols-security-e9fd42d72e7c0a150fd2dca9347be87d">many states \u003c/a> by Trump loyalists ahead of Biden’s inauguration. In a dark foreshadowing, the Washington Monument was closed to the public and the inauguration ceremony on the west steps of the Capitol will be off limits to the public.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It all added up to stunning final moments for Trump’s presidency as Democrats and a growing number of Republicans declare he is unfit for office and could do more damage after inciting a mob that violently ransacked the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="47921270-2e30-11eb-ee86-a56c9bb3ab33">\u003c/div>\u003cp>A Capitol police officer died from injuries suffered in the riot, and police shot a woman during the violence. Three others died in what authorities said were medical emergencies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Late Monday, the entire Congressional Hispanic Caucus, all 34 members, unanimously agreed to support impeachment, calling for Trump\'s immediate removal.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is clear that every moment Trump remains in office, America is at risk,” said a statement from the caucus, led by Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Ca. It said Trump "must be held accountable” for his actions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Democrats aren\'t the only ones who say Trump needs to go. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., spoke to House GOP colleagues late Monday of the significance of the vote, and encouraged them to consider it a “vote of conscience,” according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the private call. She has spoken critically of Trump\'s actions but has not said publicly how she will vote.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania joined GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska over the weekend in calling for Trump to “go away as soon as possible.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pence and Trump met late Monday for the first time since the Capitol attack, and had a “good conversation” pledging to continue working for the remainder of their terms, said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9894628968">Full Coverage: Politics\u003c/div>\u003cp>Pence has given no indication he would proceed with invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. No member of the Cabinet has publicly called for Trump to be removed from office through the 25th Amendment process.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As security tightened, Biden said Monday he was “not afraid” of taking the oath of office outside at the Capitol.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As for the rioters, Biden said, “It is critically important that there’ll be a real serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatening the lives, defacing public property, caused great damage -- that they be held accountable.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden said he’s had conversations with senators ahead of a possible impeachment trial, which some have worried would cloud the opening days of his administration. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer was exploring ways to immediately convene the Senate for the trial as soon as the House acts, though Republican leader Mitch McConnell would need to agree. The president-elect suggested splitting the Senate\'s time, perhaps “go a half day on dealing with impeachment, a half day on getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate, as well as moving on the package" for more COVID relief.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As Congress resumes, an uneasiness swept government. Another lawmaker, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., announced Tuesday she had tested positive for COVID-19 after sheltering during the siege. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Many lawmakers may choose to vote by proxy rather than come to Washington, a process that was put in place last year to limit the health risks of travel. \u003c/p>\u003cp>House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has discouraged GOP lawmakers from using the proxy option. But during a call with them he loosened his strict opposition for this week\'s votes, according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private call.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Among Trump\'s closest allies in Congress, McCarthy said in a letter to colleagues that “impeachment at this time would have the opposite effect of bringing our country together.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>He said he would review possible censure of the president. But House Republicans are split and a few may vote to impeach. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Democrats say they have the votes for impeachment. The impeachment bill from Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Ted Lieu of California, Raskin of Maryland and Jerrold Nadler of New York draws from Trump\'s own false statements about his election defeat to Biden. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Judges across the country, including some nominated by Trump, have repeatedly dismissed cases challenging the election results, and former Attorney General William Barr, a Trump ally, has said there was no sign of widespread fraud. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The impeachment legislation also details Trump\'s pressure on state officials in Georgia to “find” him more votes, as well as his White House rally ahead of the Capitol siege, in which he encouraged thousands of supporters last Wednesday to “fight like hell” and march to the building.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The mob overpowered police, broke through security lines and windows and rampaged through the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to scatter as they were finalizing Biden’s victory over Trump in the Electoral College. \u003c/p>\u003cp>While some have questioned impeaching the president so close to the end of his term, Democrats and others argue he must be prevented from holding future public office. \u003c/p>\u003cp>There is precedent for pursuing impeachment after an official leaves office. In 1876, during the Ulysses Grant administration, War Secretary William Belknap was impeached by the House the day he resigned, and the Senate convened a trial months later. He was acquitted.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Barrow reported from Wilmington, Delaware.

                            '\u003cp>Prosecutors have brought dozens of cases after the deadly attack at the U.S. Capitol, and more charges are expected in the coming days as investigators identify more members of the pro-Trump mob.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Investigators are collecting tips from the public, interviewing witnesses and going through photos, videos and social media accounts to collect evidence against the attackers who overran the Capitol to stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden as the next president. And those who’ve been charged so far could lead investigators to others who joined in the violent siege on Capitol Hill. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Some questions and answers about the investigation into the Capitol breach:\u003c/p>\u003cp>HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CHARGED? \u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia has brought federal charges against about 20 people so far, while 40 others have been charged in D.C.\'s Superior Court. The people charged in Superior Court are mainly accused of things like curfew violations and gun crimes. Those being tried in federal court, where prosecutors can generally secure longer sentences, are charged with offenses such as violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, assaulting a federal law enforcement officer and threatening House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Tuesday, federal agents \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-riots-arrests-brooklyn-theft-be62a48e605c8916c5183e70bd6e3a25">arrested the son of a New York City judge\u003c/a>, who was seen inside the Capitol wearing a fur costume and a police vest authorities say he stole during the mayhem. Images posted on social media showed agents appearing to remove part of Aaron Mostofsky\'s fur getup from the Brooklyn home where he was arrested. He faces charges including theft of government property.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Federal authorities on Sunday \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/riots-arrests-texas-capitol-siege-8a0b6c3641579af67d5919605a1e37e9">arrested two men\u003c/a> who were photographed with plastic restraints inside the Capitol. Investigators said they used social media and livestream videos to identify Eric Munchel of Tennessee as the masked person seen in photos carrying plastic hand restraints in the Senate chamber.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Retired Lt. Col. Larry Rendall Brock Jr. of Texas was photographed on the Senate floor carrying zip-tie handcuffs and wearing a military-style helmet and vest, authorities said. Brock\'s ex-wife helped authorities identify him, according to court documents. He confirmed to The New Yorker that he was the man in the photographs and claimed he found the zip-tie handcuffs on the floor. “I wish I had not picked those up,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHY HAVEN’T MORE PEOPLE BEEN CHARGED?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Authorities are working to identify more suspects, and more charges are expected. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Many people were allowed to leave the Capitol freely on the day of the attack, so investigators have to sort through a sea of photos, video, social media posts and tips from the public to see who was there and track them down.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Federal prosecutors across the U.S. have also said people could face charges in their home states if they traveled to Washington and took part in the assault.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Massachusetts\' top federal prosecutors said Monday that his office has received “lots of tips" and has investigations underway. But for prosecutors outside Washington to bring a case, they would need evidence that someone traveled there with plans to participate in the destruction and violence, said U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Much of what happened in the District looked like — at least for most of the participants — it was pretty spontaneous," Lelling said in an interview. “So in many respects, we may be looking for something that just doesn\'t exist. But we will look.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>COULD THEY FACE MORE SERIOUS CHARGES? \u003c/p>\u003cp>Prosecutors can tack on more serious charges as they gather more evidence. Michael Sherwin, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, has said authorities are not keeping anything out of their “ \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/arrests-district-of-columbia-crime-b21c12ba136e54f884958015a898937c">arsenal for potential charges\u003c/a>.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The FBI has also opened a murder probe into the death of Capitol police officer Brian D. Sicknick, who was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher, according to law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Experts say federal prosecutors could bring rarely used seditious conspiracy charges, which call for up to 20 years in prison, against some of the attackers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After protests across the U.S. over police brutality in the summer, then-Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen told prosecutors in September that they should \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/state-courts-violent-crime-arson-violence-crime-cbca8672a70f9f170a086a7a252a751e">consider using the sedition charge \u003c/a> against violent demonstrators. Rosen, who took over the top Justice Department job when Attorney General William Barr stepped down last month, said the charge does not require proof of a plot to overthrow the U.S. government and gave the hypothetical example of a group that “has conspired to take a federal courthouse or other federal property by force.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>COULD TRUMP BE CHARGED? \u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump urged the crowd to march on the Capitol, even promising to go with them, though he didn’t. The president told his supporters to “fight” to stop the “steal” of the election, while his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, called for “trial by combat.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The legal bar for \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-violence-court-decisions-3f27e4393e83d2967cf25bd18db5b268">charging the president or any other speakers \u003c/a> at the rally with inciting violence is high. Experts say it might be tough to prove in a normal prosecution that the president intended for violence to happen on Capitol Hill. \u003c/p>\u003cp>However, Trump faces a charge of “incitement of insurrection” in an impeachment resolution to be debated by the House on Wednesday as part of an extraordinary effort to remove Trump in the final days of his presidency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>COULD ANY OFFICERS FACE CHARGES? \u003c/p>\u003cp>At least two Capitol police officers, one who took a selfie with the attackers and another who put on a Make America Great Again hat, have been suspended. At least a dozen more are under internal investigation for their behavior during the uprising, according to lawmakers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Capitol officer who shot Ashli Babbitt, a Trump supporter who was trying to climb through a broken window into the Speaker’s lobby, has been placed on administrative leave per agency policy, and the shooting is under investigation by Capitol police and the Metropolitan Police Department.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Richer reported from Boston.

He wouldn\'t be specific about any response plans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There are those who demonstrated last week their intent on insurrection, and we don’t want as Vermonters to fall into a trap of coming and inadvertently supporting that," Schirling said.\u003c/p>\u003cp> “While we don’t script where and when folks should exercise their First Amendment rights, we would ask that people think twice about whether these two days that have been identified, the 17th and the 20th, are the times to do that,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>CONGRESSMAN TESTS NEGATIVE\u003c/p>\u003cp>U.S. Rep.

                            '\u003cp>MEISSEN, Germany (AP) — The caskets are stacked three high in the Meissen crematorium\'s somber memorial hall, piled up in empty offices and stored in hallways. Many are sealed with plastic wrapping, others are labeled “infection risk,” “urgent” or simply “COVID.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>A surge of coronavirus deaths in this corner of eastern Germany has boosted business for crematorium manager Joerg Schaldach and his staff, but nobody is celebrating.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The situation is a little bit tense for us at the moment,” Schaldach said as another undertaker\'s van pulled up outside.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The crematorium would typically have 70 to 100 caskets on site at this time of year, when the flu season takes its toll on the elderly.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It’s normal for more people to die in winter than in summer," said Schaldach. "That’s always been the case.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Now he has 300 bodies waiting to be cremated and each day dozens more are delivered to the modernist building on a hill overlooking Meissen, an ancient town better known for its delicate porcelain and impressive Gothic castle.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Monday, Meissen county once again took the unwanted lead in Germany\'s COVID-19 tables, with an infection rate three times the national average. The state of Saxony, where Meissen is located, includes six of the 10 worst-hit counties in Germany.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="33e25770-2e30-11eb-b6c5-8986b1f9d65e">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Schaldach says the crematorium is doing its best to keep up with demand, firing up the twin furnaces every 45 minutes and managing 60 cremations a day.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The ashes still end up in the right urn,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But whereas staff would normally try to ensure the deceased look good for relatives to bid their final farewells, infection rules now mean the caskets of COVID victims have to remain shut throughout, making the entire process even harder for those involved.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s our business, we’ve seen death many, many times," said Schaldach. "The problem we see is that the grieving relatives need our help. And at the moment, there’s a greater need for words of consolation because they’ve given their deceased loved one to the ambulance and then they never see them again.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some have linked Saxony\'s high infection rate to wider anti-government sentiment in a state where over a quarter voted for the far-right Alternative for Germany party at the last national election. Its lawmakers have objected to the need to wear masks, limits on people gathering and the closure of stores. A few have even denied the existence of a pandemic outright.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Other commentators have noted the state\'s large number of elderly and its reliance on nursing home workers from the neighboring Czech Republic, where COVID-19 infections are even higher.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Officials in Meissen, including the head of the county administration, the local doctors association and the lawmaker representing the region in parliament, an ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, all declined to be interviewed about the situation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Saxony’s governor, Michael Kretschmer, acknowledged in a recent interview with daily Freie Presse that he had underestimated the impact of the pandemic in his state and paid too much attention to those calling for businesses and schools to remain open.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9900349496">Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic\u003c/div>\u003cp>A video showing Kretschmer talking to anti-lockdown protesters outside his home Sunday ends with him walking away after one person dons a mask made to look like the German Imperial War Flag, a symbol favored by far-right extremists.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Schaldach, the crematorium manager, says most people in Saxony accept the rules. But he, too, has read comments on social media branding reports about bodies piling up at his crematorium as fake news.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Those who believe in conspiracy theories can’t be helped. We don’t want to debate with them," he told The Associated Press. "They have their beliefs and we have our knowledge.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Down in Meissen, the streets are empty, devoid of the usual tourists or even the bustle of locals. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Franziska Schlieter runs a gourmet food store in the historic city center that\'s among the few allowed to stay open amid the lockdown. Her store, which has been run by five generations of her family, is being sustained by a trickle of regulars buying lottery cards and gift baskets.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In the Bible, God sent people plagues when they didn’t behave,” said Schlieter, who feels easing the lockdown over Christmas was a mistake. “Sometimes I have to think of that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>On the cobblestone square, Matthias Huth tends a lone food truck outside his shuttered restaurant. He defends those who have questioned the government’s COVID-19 restrictions, but says skepticism shouldn’t justify denial.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Conversations are starting to change,” Huth said as he served up a dish of chopped blood sausage, sauerkraut and mash known locally as ‘Dead Grandma.’ “Everyone wants it to be over.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kerstin Sopke contributed to this report.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic">https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic, https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine\u003c/a> and \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\u003c/a>\u003c/p>',

That won\'t happen overnight, not until officials try to sort out whether lags in reporting could be the reason for what appears to be subpar performance.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Azar also said the government will stop holding back the required second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, practically doubling supply. Both those shots require two doses to achieve optimum protection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Additionally, Washington is urging states to immediately start vaccinating other groups lower down the priority scale, including people age 65 and older and younger people with certain health problems. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="74fbdad0-2e30-11eb-e940-db0f7b1861c8">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The move to increase the supply of vaccines better aligns the outgoing administration with the new Biden-Harris team. On Friday, \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-ap-top-news-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-f7bb372f73a4f204ec540d39a4409e18">President-elect Joe Biden said he will rapidly release most available vaccine doses\u003c/a> to protect more people. He said he supported immediately releasing vaccines that health authorities were holding back out of caution, to guarantee they would be available for people needing their second dose.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This next phase reflects the urgency of the situation,” said Azar. “Every vaccine dose sitting in a warehouse rather than going into an arm could mean one more death that could have been avoided."\u003c/p>\u003cp>Initially the government had been holding back second doses as a safety precaution against potential shortfalls in production. Now, officials say they are confident the needed supply will be there. And people needing a second dose will have priority.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Simultaneously, Azar gave states the green light to provide more places where people can get shots. Those locations can include tens of thousands of pharmacies, federally supported community health centers that serve low-income communities, and mass vaccination sites already being set up in some states.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As of Monday morning, the government had distributed about 25.5 million doses to states, U.S. territories and major cities. But only about 9 million people had received their first shot, \u003ca href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s online tracker.\u003c/a> That means only about 35% of the available vaccines had been administered.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Initially, the shots were going to health care workers and nursing home residents. Those 75 and older were next in line. \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-vaccine-rollout-us-f1c942e2d3d23cfd4fca571426154a42">But problems arose even in vaccinating that limited pool of people.\u003c/a> Some hospital and nursing home workers have been hesitant to get the vaccine. Scheduling issues created delays in getting shots to nursing homes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some states, including Arizona, have or are planning to open up \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/mlb-michigan-coronavirus-pandemic-gretchen-whitmer-c9be214795c5a12a1b1ba505d856c048"> mass vaccination centers\u003c/a>, aiming to inoculate thousands of people a day in a single location. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis opened up vaccinations to people 65 and older. In other states, local health authorities have started asking residents 65 and older to register, in anticipation the vaccination campaign would be expanded.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Although Azar said the shift in strategy was a natural evolution of the Trump administration\'s efforts, as recently as Friday he had raised questions about whether Biden\'s call to accelerate supplies was prudent. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Tuesday, he also sought to deflect blame to the states for the slow uptake of vaccines. Azar said some states are being “overly prescriptive and trying to micromanage every single dose of vaccine,” leading to bottlenecks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Azar also criticized what he called “the hospitalization of vaccine distribution,” saying “we have too much vaccine sitting in freezers in hospitals.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>State and local officials are sure to point out that it was the federal government that recommended putting health care workers at the front of the vaccination line.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Trump administration directed a crash effort to develop, manufacture and deliver vaccines, hoping to avoid a repeat of earlier debacles with coronavirus testing. Dubbed “Operation Warp Speed,” it has produced two highly effective vaccines, with more on the way.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Each state has its own plan for who should be vaccinated, based on CDC recommendations that gave first priority to health care workers and nursing home residents. Some critics say the administration\'s planning should have extended into helping states administer the shots after they were delivered. Congress has recently approved more than $8 billion for that.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The slow pace of the vaccine rollout has frustrated many Americans at a time when the coronavirus death toll has continued to rise. More than 376,000 people in the U.S. have died, according to the Johns Hopkins database.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9902935380">Full Coverage: Coronavirus vaccine\u003c/div>\u003cp>Azar said the pace of vaccinations has picked up, hitting 700,000 a day recently and on track to reach 1 million daily. But the American Hospital Association estimates 1.8 million vaccinations a day are needed, seven days a week, to achieve widespread immunity by the middle of this year. Biden has set a goal of 100 million shots administered in his first 100 days.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re in a race against this virus and quite frankly, we’re behind,” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams told “Fox &amp; Friends.” Public health advocates agree.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Bottom line is we need to get the most vaccine in the most arms as quickly as we can and we need to make sure people get the second dose — those are not necessarily at odds with each other,” said Chrissie Juliano, of the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents leaders of large metropolitan health departments. “The public health prevention measures we are asking people to do — stay home, mask up, social distance — aren’t getting us to where we need to be. We need to be bold and we need to respond with renewed urgency.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden is expected to give a speech Thursday outlining his plan to speed vaccines to more people in the first part of his administration. His transition team has vowed to release as many vaccine doses as possible, rather than continuing what had been the Trump administration policy of holding back millions of doses to ensure there would be enough supply to allow those getting the first shot to get a second one.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Azar said they\'ll brief the Biden transition team on the changes, but didn\'t seek their blessing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writers Candice Choi in New York, Carole Feldman in Washington, and Michelle R.

Switzerland approved the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday and plans to immunize about 4% of its population using that and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Britain gave its approval to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine last month and has been using it. India approved it this month. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As part of its strategy to obtain as many different COVID-19 vaccines as possible for Europeans, the EU said it had concluded early talks with French biotech company Valneva to secure up to 60 million doses of vaccine.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="69207610-2e30-11eb-a180-61766f331f75">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Valneva previously signed a deal with Britain to provide tens of millions of doses of its shot, which is developed using similar technology to that used to make flu vaccines. The EU has sealed six vaccine contracts for up to 2 billion doses, many more than are necessary to cover its population of approximately 450 million. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be a key vaccine for many countries because of its low cost, availability and ease of use. It can be kept in refrigerators rather than the ultra-cold storage that the Pfizer vaccine requires.

(AP) — The number of people who have died of COVID-19 in Rhode Island is approaching 2,000, according to state Department of Health statistics released Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With 23 more fatalities reported, the total number of virus-related deaths during the pandemic has climbed to 1,970. Nationally, almost 378,000 people have died, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The health department also reported more than 660 new confirmed cases of the disease from the previous day and a daily positivity rate of 5.7%.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The latest seven-day average positivity rate in Rhode Island is now 6.56%. State health departments are calculating positivity rate differently across the country, but for Rhode Island the AP calculates the rate by dividing new cases by test encounters using data from The COVID Tracking Project.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Rhode Island has risen over the past two weeks from more than 767 on Dec. 28 to more than 1,128 on Monday, according to the project.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There were more than 400 people in the state's hospitals with the disease as of Sunday, up slightly from the previous day.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT DONATIONS\u003c/p>\u003cp>Discount retailer Ocean State Job Lot is donating $1.7 million worth of face shields and masks, disinfecting hand wipes, and hand sanitizer through its charitable foundation to police and fire departments in communities where its stores are located.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“As this global health crisis continues to take a toll on our health care and public safety systems, it’s imperative to provide any support and relief to our frontline workers that we can,” David Sarlitto, Executive Director of the Ocean State Job Lot Charitable Foundation said in a statement Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The North Kingstown-based company has 142 stores in New England, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The company's charitable foundation has now distributed more than $15 million worth of critical supplies needed in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>RETURN TO CLASSROOM\u003c/p>\u003cp>A Rhode Island school district criticized by Gov. Gina Raimondo for not bringing all its students back to the classroom will resume in-person learning for all children later this month.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Warwick's kindergarten and elementary school students began returning in October and November, but classes for older students remained exclusively remote. Now, middle and high school students are scheduled to resume in-person lessons on a hybrid model on Jan. 21.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Superintendent Philip Thornton told The Providence Journal that several factors make an in-person return possible, including the installation of 1,400 air purifiers, with at least two in every classroom, additional protective and safety equipment, including plexiglass shields where needed. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“At this point, we’ve done what we needed to get ready,” Thornton said. “In our last parents’ survey, a large majority expressed the desire to go back.”\u003c/p>",

                            '\u003cp>MEXICO CITY (AP) — Farmers digging in a citrus grove near Mexico’s Gulf coast have found a striking, six-foot-tall statue of a female figure who may represent an elite woman rather than a goddess, or some mixture of the two, experts said Friday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The National Institute of Anthropology and History said it was the first such statue found in a region known as the Huasteca. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The carved woman has an elaborate hairpiece and marks of status, and may date to around 1450 to 1521, the institute said. While the site where it was found is nearer to the pre-Hispanic ruin site of El Tajín, the statue shows some influences of the Aztecs. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Farmers digging in the grove found it on New Year\'s Day and quickly reported it to authorities. The area where it was found was not previously known to be an archeological site, and the stone statue may have been moved from some unknown original site.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Just who the open-mouthed, wide-eyed statue depicts remains something of a mystery.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Institute archaeologist María Eugenia Maldonado Vite wrote that “this could be a ruler, based on her posture and attire, more than a goddess.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="0f5b3200-2e30-11eb-d820-d306f3e7d042">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Maldonado added it could be “a late fusion between the Teem goddesses and women of high political or social status in the Huasteca.” Those goddesses were part of a fertility cult.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Susan Gillespie, an anthropology professor at the University of Florida, said there “there are quite a few pre-Hispanic depictions of elite women and female rulers elsewhere, best known among the Classic Maya but also in Classic Zapotec bas-reliefs and Postclassic Mixtec codices.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Colonial era Aztec documents mentioned women ‘rulers’ or at least holders of the crown to pass on to their successors ... so that is not a surprise,” Gillespie added. “Women were highly valued in the pre-Hispanic era, drastically losing their status only after the conquest.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>However, she noted that “if there is only one such find, it’s hard to say whether it is significant, or even correctly identified. Archaeology works best with repeated occurrences, to show a pattern.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 1994 in the Mayan ruin site of Palenque, archaeologists found the tomb of a woman dubbed The Red Queen because of the red pigment covering her tomb. But it has never been firmly established that the woman, whose tomb dates from between 600 and 700 A.D., was a ruler of Palenque.\u003c/p>',

Both still pale in comparison to the largest prize, a $1.58 billion Powerball jackpot won by three players in 2016.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Lottery prizes have been growing more slowly since last spring, when officials reduced guaranteed minimums and stopped promising specific increases because the coronavirus caused sales to slow.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="25575230-2e30-11eb-b92b-f7dbf8b7d5b7">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Carole Gentry, a spokeswoman for Maryland Lottery and Gaming, said Monday that the prizes are giant now mainly because it\'s been months since anyone won either jackpot. But Gentry also speculated that more people were buying tickets because “it\'s something fun to focus on in the new year," causing prizes to rise more quickly.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As fun as it can be to play the games, people should realize their chance of winning the big prizes are incredibly small. The odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are one in 292.2 million, and the chances are even worse for Mega Millions at one in 302.5 million.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The jackpots promoted by lotteries also refer to winners who take an annuity option, in which prizes are paid out over 30 years. Nearly all winners actually opt for the cash option, which for Mega Millions would now be an estimated $451.8 million and for Powerball is $411.4 million.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mega Millions and Powerball are both played in 45 states as well as Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball also is offered in Puerto Rico.\u003c/p>',

                            '\u003cp>MADRID (AP) — Holding the red cape outstretched, one boy practices making an elegant swivel as his fellow pupil slowly sweeps past with a pair of bull horns held in front. \u003c/p>\u003cp>They are students of the Bullfighting School at the Las Ventas bullring in Madrid, where children as young as nine can begin learning this deadly dance of human and beast so closely associated with Spanish identity.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The school was closed from March to August when Spain went into one of the world’s strictest lockdowns to stem the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bullfighting, whose decline in Spain corresponds with a rise in an interest for animal rights, has barely come back since the lockdown, with the public still not allowed into large outdoor events including professional sporting events. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="d00a19cb1f88414e9bce206a131eb526">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="ce2383157c1d49edae1e068492f39b6b">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="e1866332056d4cfca66c5bd563cbfefd">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="a55b631be25f48d199c5ac30f9d2793a">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But teacher Miguel Rodríguez, a former torero, said his school has adapted like the rest of society to the pandemic era. Face masks and hand disinfectant are mandatory inside the school’s indoor workout room. When training outdoors in the sand-covered ring, masks are optional but social distancing is respected. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Considering that this world was already being hard-hit before (the pandemic), the excitement that the boys have brought back after the lockdown is incredible,” Rodríguez said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When students arrive for afternoon classes after their regular school, they all address Rodríguez and the other teachers with a deferential “Good afternoon, maestro.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>They exercise in a small gym, running outside for long stretches with and without the cape to build endurance and agility with the equipment. They train in the techniques of facing down the bull with the poise sought by aficionados and the precision that is key to emerging unscathed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>They break into pairs, one acting as the bullfighter, the other as the bull. The child playing the bull holds two bull horns mounted on a plastic frame they can easily maneuver to mimic the runs the animal takes at the bullfighter. They move as if in slow motion, focusing on learning the smooth movements of a bull pass through a cape. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="ad36a8a9782241c28d679552df3d2689">\u003c/div>\u003cp>For Rodríguez, the mission of the school goes beyond the ring. He said it requires pupils to maintain good grades in school and their teachers want them to take away “a series of values: respect, a work ethic, and sacrifice.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Yet bullfighting has fallen out of favor with a large section of Spanish society, particularly the urban young. Northeastern Catalonia banned bullfighting in 2010, even though a court later overturned the regional law. Other regions have followed suit. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9904532591">Full Coverage:  Photography\u003c/div>\u003cp>But that has not stopped schools from operating and regions where it is still popular from supporting what many still consider a key part of Spain’s cultural patrimony.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Las Ventas is one of the most prized venues in bullfighting, and a privileged place for its pupils to learn. It is the biggest ring in Spain with a capacity for more than 23,000 spectators and the third largest in the world. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That helps draw students from all over Spain and from as far abroad as France and South America. The school currently has around 70 students, including four girls. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At the age of 14, aspiring matadores can face bulls of up to 2 years old in a bullring without spectators. At age 16, they can turn professional -- if they have the right stuff.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is very difficult to become a professional,” Rodríguez said. “You have to be very gifted and work very hard. Of 100 boys, maybe 5 or 6 will become bullfighters. A true great only comes once in a decade.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="f65f4da4d6724898949cf01814ef7e21">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="756fb7da02564c399852884247775fb0">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="0d798299144e48e19492d1c832b6cef6">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="2e7ae4fac837436d99b5e777e866648e">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="d807f42ea800492da197be4e64bb6e6c">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="0ad97982236d4572831a80b4d89d2163">\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writer Joseph Wilson contributed to this report from Barcelona.\u003c/p>',

The park has been closed to the public since Dec. 6 as part of the state of California\'s lockdown efforts to curb coronavirus cases.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Veterinarians are closely monitoring the gorillas and they will remain in their habitat at the park, north of San Diego, Peterson said. For now, they are being given vitamins, fluid and food but no specific treatment for the virus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Aside from some congestion and coughing, the gorillas are doing well,” Peterson said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>While other wildlife has contracted the coronavirus from minks to tigers, this is the first known instance of transmission to great apes and it is unknown if they will have any serious reaction. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Wildlife experts have expressed concern about the coronavirus infecting gorillas, an endangered species that share 98.4 percent of their DNA with humans and are inherently social animals.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\'676356c338a74235bf4922e7f7692d5d\' class=\'media-placeholder\'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The gorillas infected at the San Diego safari park are western lowland gorillas, whose population has declined by more than 60% over the last two decades because of poaching and disease, according to the World Wildlife Fund. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The safari park tested feces of the troop of gorillas after two apes began coughing Jan. 6. Positive test results were confirmed by the U.S Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Services Laboratories in three gorillas. Feces from all eight in the troop are being taken for testing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Zoo officials are talking to experts who have been treating the coronavirus in humans in case the animals\' develop more severe symptoms. They will remain together since separating them could be harmful to the gorillas that live in tight-knit groups.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="5b93e640-2e30-11eb-9abf-2f2f7b304a0f">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“This is wildlife, and they have their own resiliency and can heal differently than we do," Peterson said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The safari park on Monday added more safety measures for its staff, including requiring face shields and eye goggles when working in contact with the animals. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The confirmation that gorillas are susceptible to the coronavirus contributes to information about how the pandemic may affect these species in their native habitats where they come into contact with humans and human materials, the park officials said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>San Diego Zoo Safari Park plans to share what it learns with health officials, conservationists and scientists to develop steps to protect gorillas in the forests of Africa. \u003c/p>',

                        '\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — Barely a month into a mass vaccination campaign to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration unexpectedly shifted gears Tuesday to speed the delivery of shots. The move came after widespread concern over a slow start even as coronavirus cases and deaths reach new highs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced a series of major changes to increase supply of vaccines and expand the age groups eligible as well as locations where people can get shots.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One change will have some teeth to it. Azar said going forward the federal government will base each state\'s allocation of vaccines partly on how successful states have been in administering those already provided.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“If you are not using vaccines that you have the right to, then we should be rebalancing to states that are using that vaccine," Azar said at news conference. That won\'t happen overnight, not until officials try to sort out whether lags in reporting could be the reason for what appears to be subpar performance.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Azar also said the government will stop holding back the required second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, practically doubling supply. Both those shots require two doses to achieve optimum protection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Additionally, Washington is urging states to immediately start vaccinating other groups lower down the priority scale, including people age 65 and older and younger people with certain health problems. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="74fbdad0-2e30-11eb-e940-db0f7b1861c8">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The move to increase the supply of vaccines better aligns the outgoing administration with the new Biden-Harris team. On Friday, \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-ap-top-news-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-f7bb372f73a4f204ec540d39a4409e18">President-elect Joe Biden said he will rapidly release most available vaccine doses\u003c/a> to protect more people. He said he supported immediately releasing vaccines that health authorities were holding back out of caution, to guarantee they would be available for people needing their second dose.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This next phase reflects the urgency of the situation,” said Azar. “Every vaccine dose sitting in a warehouse rather than going into an arm could mean one more death that could have been avoided."\u003c/p>\u003cp>Initially the government had been holding back second doses as a safety precaution against potential shortfalls in production. Now, officials say they are confident the needed supply will be there. And people needing a second dose will have priority.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Simultaneously, Azar gave states the green light to provide more places where people can get shots. Those locations can include tens of thousands of pharmacies, federally supported community health centers that serve low-income communities, and mass vaccination sites already being set up in some states.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As of Monday morning, the government had distributed about 25.5 million doses to states, U.S. territories and major cities. But only about 9 million people had received their first shot, \u003ca href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s online tracker.\u003c/a> That means only about 35% of the available vaccines had been administered.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Initially, the shots were going to health care workers and nursing home residents.

In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis opened up vaccinations to people 65 and older. In other states, local health authorities have started asking residents 65 and older to register, in anticipation the vaccination campaign would be expanded.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Although Azar said the shift in strategy was a natural evolution of the Trump administration\'s efforts, as recently as Friday he had raised questions about whether Biden\'s call to accelerate supplies was prudent. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Tuesday, he also sought to deflect blame to the states for the slow uptake of vaccines. Azar said some states are being “overly prescriptive and trying to micromanage every single dose of vaccine,” leading to bottlenecks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Azar also criticized what he called “the hospitalization of vaccine distribution,” saying “we have too much vaccine sitting in freezers in hospitals.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>State and local officials are sure to point out that it was the federal government that recommended putting health care workers at the front of the vaccination line.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Trump administration directed a crash effort to develop, manufacture and deliver vaccines, hoping to avoid a repeat of earlier debacles with coronavirus testing. Dubbed “Operation Warp Speed,” it has produced two highly effective vaccines, with more on the way.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Each state has its own plan for who should be vaccinated, based on CDC recommendations that gave first priority to health care workers and nursing home residents. Some critics say the administration\'s planning should have extended into helping states administer the shots after they were delivered. Congress has recently approved more than $8 billion for that.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The slow pace of the vaccine rollout has frustrated many Americans at a time when the coronavirus death toll has continued to rise. More than 376,000 people in the U.S. have died, according to the Johns Hopkins database.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9902935380">Full Coverage: Coronavirus vaccine\u003c/div>\u003cp>Azar said the pace of vaccinations has picked up, hitting 700,000 a day recently and on track to reach 1 million daily. But the American Hospital Association estimates 1.8 million vaccinations a day are needed, seven days a week, to achieve widespread immunity by the middle of this year. Biden has set a goal of 100 million shots administered in his first 100 days.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re in a race against this virus and quite frankly, we’re behind,” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams told “Fox &amp; Friends.” Public health advocates agree.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Bottom line is we need to get the most vaccine in the most arms as quickly as we can and we need to make sure people get the second dose — those are not necessarily at odds with each other,” said Chrissie Juliano, of the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents leaders of large metropolitan health departments. “The public health prevention measures we are asking people to do — stay home, mask up, social distance — aren’t getting us to where we need to be. We need to be bold and we need to respond with renewed urgency.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden is expected to give a speech Thursday outlining his plan to speed vaccines to more people in the first part of his administration. His transition team has vowed to release as many vaccine doses as possible, rather than continuing what had been the Trump administration policy of holding back millions of doses to ensure there would be enough supply to allow those getting the first shot to get a second one.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Azar said they\'ll brief the Biden transition team on the changes, but didn\'t seek their blessing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writers Candice Choi in New York, Carole Feldman in Washington, and Michelle R.

And those who’ve been charged so far could lead investigators to others who joined in the violent siege on Capitol Hill. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Some questions and answers about the investigation into the Capitol breach:\u003c/p>\u003cp>HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CHARGED? \u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia has brought federal charges against about 20 people so far, while 40 others have been charged in D.C.\'s Superior Court. The people charged in Superior Court are mainly accused of things like curfew violations and gun crimes. Those being tried in federal court, where prosecutors can generally secure longer sentences, are charged with offenses such as violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, assaulting a federal law enforcement officer and threatening House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Tuesday, federal agents \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-riots-arrests-brooklyn-theft-be62a48e605c8916c5183e70bd6e3a25">arrested the son of a New York City judge\u003c/a>, who was seen inside the Capitol wearing a fur costume and a police vest authorities say he stole during the mayhem. Images posted on social media showed agents appearing to remove part of Aaron Mostofsky\'s fur getup from the Brooklyn home where he was arrested. He faces charges including theft of government property.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Federal authorities on Sunday \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/riots-arrests-texas-capitol-siege-8a0b6c3641579af67d5919605a1e37e9">arrested two men\u003c/a> who were photographed with plastic restraints inside the Capitol. Investigators said they used social media and livestream videos to identify Eric Munchel of Tennessee as the masked person seen in photos carrying plastic hand restraints in the Senate chamber.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Retired Lt. Col. Larry Rendall Brock Jr. of Texas was photographed on the Senate floor carrying zip-tie handcuffs and wearing a military-style helmet and vest, authorities said. Brock\'s ex-wife helped authorities identify him, according to court documents. He confirmed to The New Yorker that he was the man in the photographs and claimed he found the zip-tie handcuffs on the floor. “I wish I had not picked those up,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHY HAVEN’T MORE PEOPLE BEEN CHARGED?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Authorities are working to identify more suspects, and more charges are expected. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Many people were allowed to leave the Capitol freely on the day of the attack, so investigators have to sort through a sea of photos, video, social media posts and tips from the public to see who was there and track them down.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Federal prosecutors across the U.S. have also said people could face charges in their home states if they traveled to Washington and took part in the assault.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Massachusetts\' top federal prosecutors said Monday that his office has received “lots of tips" and has investigations underway. But for prosecutors outside Washington to bring a case, they would need evidence that someone traveled there with plans to participate in the destruction and violence, said U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Much of what happened in the District looked like — at least for most of the participants — it was pretty spontaneous," Lelling said in an interview. “So in many respects, we may be looking for something that just doesn\'t exist. But we will look.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>COULD THEY FACE MORE SERIOUS CHARGES? \u003c/p>\u003cp>Prosecutors can tack on more serious charges as they gather more evidence. Michael Sherwin, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, has said authorities are not keeping anything out of their “ \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/arrests-district-of-columbia-crime-b21c12ba136e54f884958015a898937c">arsenal for potential charges\u003c/a>.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The FBI has also opened a murder probe into the death of Capitol police officer Brian D. Sicknick, who was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher, according to law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Experts say federal prosecutors could bring rarely used seditious conspiracy charges, which call for up to 20 years in prison, against some of the attackers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After protests across the U.S. over police brutality in the summer, then-Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen told prosecutors in September that they should \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/state-courts-violent-crime-arson-violence-crime-cbca8672a70f9f170a086a7a252a751e">consider using the sedition charge \u003c/a> against violent demonstrators. Rosen, who took over the top Justice Department job when Attorney General William Barr stepped down last month, said the charge does not require proof of a plot to overthrow the U.S. government and gave the hypothetical example of a group that “has conspired to take a federal courthouse or other federal property by force.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>COULD TRUMP BE CHARGED? \u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump urged the crowd to march on the Capitol, even promising to go with them, though he didn’t. The president told his supporters to “fight” to stop the “steal” of the election, while his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, called for “trial by combat.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The legal bar for \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-violence-court-decisions-3f27e4393e83d2967cf25bd18db5b268">charging the president or any other speakers \u003c/a> at the rally with inciting violence is high. Experts say it might be tough to prove in a normal prosecution that the president intended for violence to happen on Capitol Hill. \u003c/p>\u003cp>However, Trump faces a charge of “incitement of insurrection” in an impeachment resolution to be debated by the House on Wednesday as part of an extraordinary effort to remove Trump in the final days of his presidency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>COULD ANY OFFICERS FACE CHARGES? \u003c/p>\u003cp>At least two Capitol police officers, one who took a selfie with the attackers and another who put on a Make America Great Again hat, have been suspended. At least a dozen more are under internal investigation for their behavior during the uprising, according to lawmakers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Capitol officer who shot Ashli Babbitt, a Trump supporter who was trying to climb through a broken window into the Speaker’s lobby, has been placed on administrative leave per agency policy, and the shooting is under investigation by Capitol police and the Metropolitan Police Department.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Richer reported from Boston.

The league has now postponed four games since Sunday because of the virus situation among some teams.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Magic are also supposed to play the Celtics on Friday in Boston; no determination about that game has been announced.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Celtics have eight players listed as out right now because of the league\'s protocols, and have now seen three of their games postponed this week alone.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We\'re just going to follow what the NBA" says, Washington coach Scott Brooks said. “I mean, they\'re the experts. They have all the medical, they have all the science, they have everything, all the data. ... I\'m for whatever the NBA wants us to do."\u003c/p>\u003cp>Among the actions that the NBA is working with the National Basketball Players Association to implement, according to two people familiar with the league\'s plan: urging players to stop in-game and postgame handshakes and hugs, additional mask-wearing rules especially in the bench areas, and mandates that would temporarily allow players in their home markets to only go to practices, games, workouts and tend to essential matters. The people spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither the league nor the union had announced those measures.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Wizards canceled their Tuesday practice, saying that decision was made “out of an abundance of caution." They beat the Phoenix Suns on Monday night, and are scheduled to play host to the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night. The Wizards did not identify the two players.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Based on the most recent information released by teams, though the numbers can change quickly, it seems at least 36 players in the NBA entering Tuesday are dealing with some sort of virus-related issue.

Pompeo was to have met with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg and Belgium's foreign minister while in Brussels. Initial plans for a stop in Luxembourg had been already been scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said the decision had been made to assist in the transition to the incoming Biden administration, which will assume office on Jan. 20. Since last week’s deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol by rioters encouraged by President Donald Trump, concerns have been raised about the security of Biden’s inauguration. Officials said the cancellation of Pompeo’s trip was intended to support the transition and was not related to fears of violence.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“The Department of State is well along in its transition efforts with President-elect Biden’s team,\" Ortagus said in a statement. “We are fully committed to the completion of a smooth and orderly transition process to be finalized over the next 8 days. Both the department and the President-elect’s team have been fully engaged for several weeks toward this end, and we are pleased with the level of cooperation and professionalism that has been displayed.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pompeo, who was criticized for not immediately recognizing Biden's victory over Trump in November's election, met last week with his designated successor, Antony Blinken, in what a State Department official described as a cordial meeting.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are expecting shortly a plan from the incoming administration identifying the career officials who will remain in positions of responsibility on an acting basis until the Senate confirmation process is complete for incoming officials,” Ortagus said in the statement. “As a result, we are cancelling all planned travel this week, including the secretary’s trip to Europe.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The department's most senior career diplomat, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale, who is No. 3 in the hierarchy, is expected to serve as acting secretary of state from noon on Jan. 20 until Blinken is confirmed by the Senate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The department had announced late Monday that Pompeo would be visiting Brussels on his final trip abroad.\u003c/p>",

                        "\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday accused Iran of having secret ties with the al-Qaida network and imposed new sanctions on several senior Iranian officials. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Pompeo’s comments come just a week before the Trump administration leaves office and appeared aimed at President-elect Joe Biden’s stated desire to resume negotiations with Iran over the 2015 nuclear deal. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a speech to the National Press Club just, Pompeo attacked Iran for alleged secret ties with al-Qaida, citing newly declassified intelligence suggesting Tehran harbored the group’s No. 2, Abu Muhammad al-Masri, who was killed in August, reportedly by Israeli agents.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Shiite-ruled Iran and predominantly Sunni al-Qaida are not natural allies in the Islamic world and have had a fraught relationship since the Taliban, which harbored bin Laden, took over Afghanistan in 1996. Two years later, Iran accused the Taliban of murdering several of it diplomats in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Although U.S. officials had previously confirmed the death of al-Masri and his daughter, the widow of Osama bin Laden’s son Hamza, Pompeo’s remarks were the first on-the-record comments supporting the claim.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Today, I can confirm publicly to the world for the first time, his death on Aug. 7 of last year,” Pompeo said. He also alleged that Iran had “closely monitored” al-Qaida members before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States and had stepped up such activity and had decided to actively support them following the nuclear agreement.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='92f367fa21b94dda861d466353bd9567' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Speaking after Pompeo's remarks, two senior U.S. officials told reporters that Iran had facilitated al-Masri's stay in Tehran, including by sending security guards with him on shopping excursions and granting him access to a swimming pool. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence information, spoke on condition of anonymity.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pompeo claimed that ties between al-Qaida and Iran vastly improved in 2015, when the Obama administration, along with France, Germany and Britain, were finalizing the nuclear deal. He offered no evidence for the claim. Pompeo has been adamantly opposed to the nuclear agreement since he was a member of Congress.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“A sea change was happening within the Iran-al-Qaida axis,” Pompeo said. “Iran decided to allow al-Qaida to establish a new operational headquarters, on the condition that al-Qaida operatives inside abide by the regime’s rules governing al-Qaida’s stay inside the country.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>He said that since 2015, Iran has given al-Qaida leaders greater freedom of movement inside Iran and have provided safe havens and logistical support to al-Qaida. Pompeo asserted that al-Qaida had now based its leadership in Tehran and was continuing to plot attacks on the U.S. and Western targets from there.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Iran has denied all such charges, and did so again on Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh Tuesday condemned Pompeo’s accusations as a \"repeat of blaming and fabricating false evidence” against Iran since President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear deal and began to re-impose sanctions that had been lifted under the accord.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Khatibzadeh derided Pompeo's accusations as an indication of the “failure of the maximum pressure campaign” by the Trump administration against Iran, the official IRNA news agency reported. He said Iran has had “a crystal-clear and defendable record” in fighting al-Qaida and IS terrorism.\u003c/p>",

                        '\u003cp>NEW YORK (AP) — A woman who wrongly accused a Black teenager of stealing her cellphone and tackled him at a New York City hotel appeared to back off her apology in a TV interview that aired Monday, suggesting without evidence that maybe he did try to steal her phone after all.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“So, maybe it wasn’t him but at the same time how is it so that as soon as I get asked to leave the premises after I had accused this person of stealing my phone, how is that all of a sudden they just miraculously have my phone at the back?” 22-year-old Miya Ponsetto said in the interview on “CBS This Morning." \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The interview was conducted Thursday, hours before Ponsetto was arrested in Ventura County, California, over the Dec. 26 confrontation with 14-year-old Keyon Harrold Jr. Ponsetto \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-new-york-city-manhattan-arrests-california-31ecdf43de0d782a3aee62d6032091d0">was charged Saturday in New York \u003c/a> with attempted robbery, grand larceny, acting in a manner injurious to a child and two counts of attempted assault, according to city police. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Security video released by the police shows Ponsetto frantically grabbing at Harrold as he tries to get away from her through the front door of Manhattan\'s Arlo Hotel. The teen\'s father, jazz trumpeter Keyon Harrold, has said that Ponsetto’s phone had actually been left in an Uber and was returned by the driver.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the first part of the CBS interview, broadcast \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/miya-ponsetto-arrested-1f7896743fd3cf532ff9b453f777fd94">Friday\u003c/a>, Ponsetto told host Gayle King, “I don’t feel that that is who I am as a person. I don’t feel like this one mistake does define me.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>She was frequently combative in the clips that aired Monday, interrupting King and her own attorney, Sharen H. Ghatan.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ponsetto said she was “sorry from the bottom of my heart” but added, "He’s 14? That’s what they’re claiming? Yeah, I’m 22, I’ve lived probably just the same amount of life, like honestly. I’m just as a kid at heart as he is.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>When King asked her to go over the events at the hotel, Ponsetto said, “You already asked me that at the beginning of the interview. I’m not going over it again. I would like to have a real interview with real questions and real heart and real sincere apologies. Let 2021 be the moment of healing, seriously.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ponsetto\'s arrest followed more than a week of media coverage of the hotel lobby encounter and demands by the teen’s family and activists that she face criminal charges over what was seen as an instance of racial profiling.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In the CBS interview, Ponsetto denied profiling the teenager and said her heritage is partly Puerto Rican. When King asked her if she believed a person of color could not be racist, she said, “Exactly.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>"I feel sorry that I made the family go through all that stress but at the same time it wasn’t just them going through that, "she said in a “CBS This Morning” interview that aired Friday. “But I do sincerely from the bottom of my heart apologize that if I made the son feel as if I assaulted him or if I hurt his feelings or the father’s feelings.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>At a news conference on Monday in New York City, the teen\'s family called for a boycott of the hotel, claiming it had racially profiled him in its response. \u003c/p>\u003cp>"This is the reality of Black mothers in America," said his mother, Kat Rodriguez. “Every day we must face the reality that a simple case of mistaken identity or a misunderstanding can end in tragedy.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Management of the Arlo Hotel previously posted on Facebook that they had reached out to apologize to the family.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story has been updated to correct the defendant\'s racial background. Miya Ponsetto has both Puerto Rican and Vietnamese ancestry and considers herself a person of color, not a white person, according to her lawyer.\u003c/p>',

Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, was given the authority to tap up to 15,000 Guard, but he has said that requests for assistance from the Secret Service, the U.S. Park Police and the Capitol Police have been increasing this week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Army also said Tuesday that officials are working with the Secret Service to determine which Guard members may need additional background screening. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Co., had asked Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to have the Army’s Criminal Investigation Command screen Guard members coming in to ensure they were not “sympathetic to domestic terrorists.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Army said CID will not be reviewing all the Guard, but some members may be subject to additional background screening. Traditionally, those who get within close proximity to the president -- or in this case the president-elect — are checked more closely.\u003c/p>\u003cp>So far, officials said they have not yet identified any Guard members who participated in the protests, but investigations are ongoing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a statement, the Army said the D.C. National Guard is also giving troops additional training as they arrive in the city, so they know to identify and report any extremist behavior to their commanders.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Army also said it is working with the FBI to identify people who participated in Capitol attack, adding, “any type of activity that involves violence, civil disobedience, or a breach of peace may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or under state or federal law.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>11:15 a.m.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is calling on the FBI to add anyone identified breaching the Capitol during last week’s violent riot to the federal no-fly list.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Schumer sent a letter Tuesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, saying the attack on the Capitol as Congress was voting to affirm President-elect Joe Biden’s win was “domestic terrorism.” He said those who stormed the Capitol should qualify as “insurrectionists for the No-Fly List.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Schumer told Wray that they must also be fully prosecuted to the full extent of federal law. The letter was obtained by The Associated Press.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The federal no-fly list is part of the U.S. government’s Terrorist Screening Database and prohibits anyone who “may pose a threat to civil aviation or national security” from boarding a commercial aircraft. Generally, in order to be placed on the list, the government must have information that the person presents “a threat of committing terrorism” to the aircraft or the U.S. homeland or U.S. facilities. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The no-fly list is one of the government’s most controversial post-Sept. 11 counterterrorism programs. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___ \u003c/p>\u003cp>10:55 a.m.\u003c/p>\u003cp>President Donald Trump is taking no responsibility for his role in fomenting a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A Capitol police officer died from injuries suffered in the riot, and police shot a woman during the violence. Three others died in what authorities said were medical emergencies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Speaking to reporters before traveling to Texas on Tuesday, Trump says his remarks to supporters last week were “totally appropriate.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Minutes before his supporters stormed the Capitol, Trump encouraged them to march on the seat of the nation’s government where lawmakers were tallying Electoral College votes affirming President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Trump, for months, had also spread baseless claims that the November election was fraudulent, despite his own administration’s findings to the contrary.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As rioters were still in the Capitol, Trump released a video seemingly excusing the events, saying of the rioters: “We love you. You’re very special.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>10:30 a.m.\u003c/p>\u003cp>President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday at the White House that the prospect of impeachment is causing “tremendous anger” in the nation. But he said he wants “no violence.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president spoke as he left for Texas to survey the border wall with Mexico. His remarks were his first to reporters since the Capitol attack.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On impeachment, Trump said it’s “a really terrible thing that they’re doing.” But he said, “We want no violence. Never violence.”\u003c/p>',

                        '\u003cp>TULUM, Mexico (AP) — The friends from Jackson, Mississippi, relaxed on lounge chairs dug into a white sand beach and romped in the turquoise Caribbean waters, grateful for a break from the pandemic winter in the United States.\u003c/p>\u003cp>They were among tens of thousands of American tourists who descended on Mexico\'s glittering Caribbean beaches at the close of 2020 and start of this year. Quintana Roo state, the country’s tourism crown jewel, home to Cancun, the Riviera Maya and Tulum, received 961,000 tourists during that stretch — nearly half from the U.S. — down only 25% from the previous year. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“You come here and it’s a sigh of relief from all the turmoil of the COVID,” said Latron Evans, a 40-year-old Jackson firefighter.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="e8a231959855464398142f26f0f41346">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="1171ebf67206465598a79ac543b854bb">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="9b5467fa13e7426c8f2ce719af8f13be">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But concern is spreading that the winter holiday success could be fleeting, because it came as COVID-19 infections in both Mexico and the United States, the main source of the foreign tourists, were reaching new heights — and as a new, more easily spread variant was beginning to emerge in the U.S. If a sharp rise in infections forces a new shutdown of the tourism sector, the effects would be devastating. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Tourism accounts for 87% of Quintana Roo’s gross domestic product, said state Tourism Secretary Marisol Vanegas Pérez. The state lost some 90,000 tourism jobs — only 10,000 of which have come back — and countless others that depend on tourism. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Flights from the U.S. dried up last spring as the pandemic took hold but have risen steadily since then. In December, Quintana Roo was averaging 460 air arrivals and departures per day compared to a pre-pandemic average of 500, Vanegas said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9906521625">Full Coverage: Photography\u003c/div>\u003cp>The increase in American tourists helped compensate for the Europeans, whose numbers remain sharply down. More U.S. tourists came to Quintana Roo during this pandemic-stricken holiday season than a year earlier, when the world was just beginning to learn of the coronavirus. They accounted for 9 out of 10 foreign tourists, Vanegas said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And they are staying longer, with some seemingly waiting out the pandemic at the beach, she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Officials strive to “create a tourist bubble that generates confidence in everything a tourist does,” Vanegas said, describing how the visitors move from the airport to a van to a hotel, and then to tours of sun-splashed archaeological sites certified by state health authorities. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Where there could be risk is when they leave that bubble,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For example, the throbbing crowd that packed shoulder-to-shoulder — many not wearing masks — in downtown streets and clubs to ring in the New Year in Playa del Carmen, the lively beach town between Cancun and Tulum. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="eae5aea3f77848c3ab6a42ae17d95716">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="c2674195817249f9b3d123641843427b">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="bdcde89c9ead4fae970416223b694228">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="4f8011f5b70e40ff8fdf35704fdc6aac">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Indoor venues also pose a risk: Restaurants, theaters, salons and other businesses are permitted to operate at 60% capacity, and indoor gyms at 50%. Hotels can book at 70% capacity. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Evans, the Mississippi firefighter, said he was impressed by the health measures everywhere he went. “They’re taking temperatures when you enter the building and giving you hand sanitizer every place you go," he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>His friend, Gearald Green, a 32-year-old music producer from Jackson, where nearly everyone in his immediate circle of friends has been infected, said the climate and outdoor-focused beach living inspired confidence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don’t have to try an extra amount to keep social distance because it’s the beach, it’s water and when you come out it’s not like a lot of people on top of one another," he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Vanegas said the state health department aggressively traces any reported infections. Still, there are worrisome signs. The positivity rate on COVID-19 tests in the state is nearly 50% and the weekly number of COVID-19 deaths quadrupled from the week before Christmas to the week after, according to federal government data.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Health experts fear the increase in travel through the holiday season will likely lead to spikes in places that previously seemed to have it under control.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In the most popular tourist destinations, you’re going to have epidemic activity increase again in a big way,” said Dr. Mauricio Rodríguez of the medical school at Mexico’s National Autonomous University, citing beach destinations like Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco, Quintana Roo and the Riviera Maya.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="9e9b0b8f496c4934a09002cd4966594f">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="4f6071d1b664401c982bf7b40a452eec">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The southern state of Oaxaca, which draws tourists to its colonial capital as well as its laid-back Pacific beaches, had half the number of tourists this holiday season as a year earlier. State Tourism Secretary Juan Carlos Rivera said that wasn’t bad considering the pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are going to enter in ... an economic recession in terms of tourism in the coming months, not only in Oaxaca, in the whole country,” Rivera said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>If infections increase sharply, pressure will build to close beaches again like last spring, spurring massive layoffs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When the pandemic arrived in Mexico, big hotels started laying off workers with what they called “solidarity breaks.” Workers were told it was temporary, that they’d be hired back in a month and most were let go without the benefits they deserved.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There was little debate over the health risks of promoting tourism versus the economic impact of losing all those jobs, said Alejandro Palafox-Muñoz, a professor of tourism at the University of Quintana Roo. The people who lost those jobs had no choice but to go out and look for new work to feed their families, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Saily Camacho, 25, had worked at a beach club on the island of Cozumel for two years, as a hostess, selling tours and at the cash register. Barely two weeks after the first recorded COVID-19 infection in Mexico, she was out of a job. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Camacho earned commissions from selling tours and could make $110 on a good day. After she was laid off, she lived off her savings for a month, thinking that she’d be hired back. She put finishing her college degree on hold. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Her mother and two siblings lost their tourism sector jobs too. Her mother — and many others — tried to sustain themselves by selling food from their homes via social networks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Her mother, a hotel chambermaid, finally started a new hotel job this month. After a long search, Camacho was hired as a cashier at a supermarket where it takes her almost two weeks to earn what she made on a good day at the beach club.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Before, I was working to save for my future, to buy a house, a car," Camacho said. “And now, honestly, I only work to get by, for food, for expenses.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>She still has concerns about the coronavirus, but admitted that she was buoyed by seeing tourists return. “To see tourists, truly, was something exciting, because it’s the sustenance for the island,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="749f5d026a7a44a589ba10fe17742fba">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="e4223e4dd4a34bbc880c5e17fb6c7537">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="86fb8e5597174feca880237817a8df27">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="eb351c45122e4b4ebb9a79c9bc9be01f">\u003c/div>\u003cp>__\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sherman reported from Mexico City.

                        '\u003cp>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A former Minneapolis police officer who held his knee to the neck of George Floyd for minutes will be tried separately from the three other former officers accused in his death, according to an order filed Tuesday that cites limited courtroom space due to COVID-19 restrictions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Derek Chauvin will stand trial alone in March while the other three former officers will be tried together in the summer. Judge Peter Cahill cited the limitations of physical space during the coronavirus pandemic, saying it is “impossible to comply with COVID-19 physical restrictions” given how many lawyers and support personnel that four defendants say would be present.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Prosecutors disagreed with the judge\'s decision to split the trials. A defense attorney for former officer Thomas Lane said he believed a separate trial would be better for his client, while the other defense attorneys either declined to comment or did not return messages.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Last week, prosecutors \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/health-trials-minnesota-minneapolis-racial-injustice-454f9cc571e4a7649ed7d6ed3170ce86">asked Cahill\u003c/a> to postpone the March 8 trial to June 7 to reduce public health risks associated with COVID-19. In his Monday order, which was filed Tuesday, the judge wrote that while the pandemic situation may be greatly improved by June, “the Court is not so optimistic given news reports detailing problems with the vaccine rollout.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cahill said that Hennepin County Chief Judge Toddrick Barnette requested the change after learning that each defendant planned to have co-counsel or legal support at the defense tables. Barnette looked at the configuration of the courtroom and concluded that with so many people, the space was not conducive to social distancing. Barnette wrote that he believed the courtroom could handle up to three defendants at once.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Floyd, a Black man, \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/a55d2662f200ead0da4fed9e923b60a7">died May 25\u003c/a> after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck while he was handcuffed face down on the street. Police were investigating whether Floyd used a counterfeit bill at a nearby store. In a video widely seen on social media, Floyd could be heard pleading with officers for air, saying he couldn’t breathe. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Floyd’s death sparked protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere and renewed calls for an end to police brutality and racial inequities.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chauvin \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/1e0d9bcb6e751c31c8de0794434c5730">is charged\u003c/a> with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. Former officers Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng are each charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, as well as aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Defense attorneys had \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/trials-minneapolis-racial-injustice-4d4818f4287300ed0cb28b0e36e2b2dd">argued last year\u003c/a> that the officers should be tried separately, since each officer might seek to diminish his own role in Floyd\'s arrest and death might point fingers at the other officers. Prosecutors had argued against dividing the trial, saying the evidence against all four is similar, the officers acted together and the public and witnesses should be spared the trauma of multiple trials.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office is prosecuting the case, said Tuesday that he disagrees with Cahill’s decision to separate the trials and to hold Chauvin’s in March.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The evidence against each defendant is similar and multiple trials may retraumatize eyewitnesses and family members and unnecessarily burden the State and the Court while also running the risk of prejudicing subsequent jury pools,” Ellison said in a statement. “It is also clear that COVID-19 will still be a serious threat to public health in 8 weeks’ time. ... Nevertheless, we are fully prepared and look forward to presenting our case to a jury whenever the Court deems fit.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lane’s attorney, Earl Gray, said he thinks it’s better for his client to have a trial separate from Chauvin.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In a joint trial, there’s always a spillover effect no matter what. You know a jury is supposed to consider each client separately, but that’s hard for anyone to do — common sense tells you that,” Gray said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Attorneys for Kueng and Chauvin had no comment on the judge\'s ruling. Thao\'s attorney did not return a message seeking comment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Thao, Kueng and Lane are now scheduled to stand trial together beginning Aug. 23.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writer Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.\u003c/p>',

                        '\u003cp>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Since last week’s deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, about 225 Republicans logged in to the election office in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, to change their party registration. Ethan Demme was one of them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Ever since they started denying the election result, I kind of knew it was heading this way," said Demme, the county\'s former Republican Party chairman who has opposed President Donald Trump and is now an independent. "If they kept going, I knew there’s no way I can keep going. But if you’ve been a Republican all your life, it’s hard to jump out of a big boat and into a little boat.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Officials are seeing similar scenes unfold elsewhere. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, 192 people have changed their party registration since the Jan. 6 riot. Only 13 switched to the GOP — the other 179 changed to Democrat, independent or a third party, according to Bethany Salzarulo, the director of the bureau of elections.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="d976e610-2e30-11eb-9498-898460c05481">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In Linn County, Iowa, home to Cedar Rapids, more than four dozen voters dropped their Republican Party affiliations in the 48 hours after the Capitol attack. They mostly switched to no party, elections commissioner Joel Miller said, though a small number took the highly unusual step of cancelling their registrations altogether.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The party switching pales in comparison to the more than 74 million people who voted for Trump in November. And it\'s unclear whether they\'re united in their motivations. Some may be rejecting politics altogether while others may be leaving a Republican Party they fear will be less loyal to Trump.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But they offer an early sign of the volatility ahead for the GOP as the party braces for political fallout of \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-stormed-us-34417ac51a765e297faf53eb0ad15517">the riots that Trump incited\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I do think there’s a palpable shift, from knee-jerk defense of the president to ‘wow, that was a bridge too far,’” said Kirk Adams, the former Republican speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Adams said he knew several people, including once-solid Trump supporters, who are switching their registrations. He said it may be weeks or months before the full impact of the insurrection is clear. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Minds are being changed," he said. "But you can’t go overnight from ‘I think the president’s right and the election is being stolen’ to ‘I guess he was wrong about everything.’”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Party registration doesn\'t always preview how voters will actually cast their ballots, especially when the next major national elections are nearly two years away. But party leaders across the country are expressing concern that the riots could have a lasting impact. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The GOP cannot afford any slippage in its ranks after an election that, even with record-breaking Republican turnout, saw them lose control of both the presidency and the U.S. Senate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Increasingly I’ve looked at my party in this state and our numbers are dwindling,” said Gary Eichelberger, a commissioner in suburban Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. “If we narrow the base of the party, we are going to lose this county.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9897085856">Full Coverage: Politics\u003c/div>\u003cp>Republicans in Washington are approaching the moment with caution, denouncing the insurrection and providing scant defense of Trump. But so far, few have joined \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-cabinets-inaugurations-coronavirus-pandemic-9f815ffe1e847aaffdb6a4f9cd3d7ff2">Democratic calls for the president\'s impeachment \u003c/a> and immediate removal.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Just two Senate Republicans, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania, have called on Trump to resign. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Multiple GOP officials said there was some unease about the party’s direction at the RNC winter meeting on Amelia Island, Florida, which took place a few days after the attack. Serious conversations are underway at the committee to conduct a comprehensive look at the 2020 election results to determine what the party did wrong and how to better appeal to voters, according to Henry Barbour, a RNC member from Mississippi.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Trump still has a pull on swaths of the GOP base. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A Quinnipiac Poll released on Monday found roughly three-quarters of Republicans believe Trump\'s false statements that there was widespread voter fraud in November’s election, which is what triggered the attack on the Capitol after Trump urged a crowd of supporters to go to Congress as it was set to certify the victory of President-elect Joe Biden.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Overall 7 in 10 Republicans approved of Trump’s performance as president, compared to 89% in Quinnipiac’s December poll. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“When you love President Trump, you love President Trump,” said Michele Fiore, an RNC committeewoman from Nevada. “With all of our hearts, we support him. We know he did not create the chaos that happened in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rae Chornenky, who stepped down as chair of the Maricopa County Republican Party in Arizona shortly after the election amid a power struggle with those in the state party claiming widespread election fraud, said she thinks the president still has a hammerlock on the party’s grass roots.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They just believe it was a stolen election, and they’re not going to back off that position,” Chornenky said. “He’ll be the driving force” of the GOP for years to come, Chornenky predicted of Trump.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The 2022 midterm elections may provide a test of that. Former Rep. Ryan Costello is strongly considering a run for Pennsylvania’s open Senate seat as a Republican. A longtime Trump critic, he sees the time as ripe for an explicitly anti-Trump GOP candidate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We need people willing to lose races, lose political campaigns, over this,” Costello said. “We need campaigns about the cleansing of the party. Sometimes it’s not possible to dance around landmines. Sometimes, you’ve just got to jump in there.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Riccardi from Denver.

The U.S. Treasury Department sought review from the high court after a federal appeals court ruled in September that the corporations aren\'t eligible.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Treasury Department said if the decision stands, the corporations will lose out on “hundreds of millions of dollars” in funding and be deprived of their ability to help Alaska Natives when it comes to health care, education and economic well-being.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Supreme Court included the case on its order list Friday. It\'s unclear whether it will be argued in the spring or fall session. The key question is whether the corporations are considered “tribes” under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The case has required judges, attorneys, Native American tribes and the Alaska corporations to pick apart language of the act, congressional intent and a 1975 federal law meant to strengthen tribes\' ability to govern themselves.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More than a dozen Native American tribes sued the U.S. Treasury Department last year to try to keep the money out of the hands of the corporations. They argued it should go only to the 574 tribes that have a government-to-government relationship with the United States. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Most of the money, except for about $530 million, has been distributed to Native American governments, according to court documents.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tribes initially had until Dec. 30, 2020, to spend the money, but a bill that President Donald Trump recently signed extended the deadline for another year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The case is being closely watched around Indian Country for its broader implications.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The case is also about more than money," said Paul Spruhan, an attorney with the Navajo Nation, which is a plaintiff in the case. “It is also about the role of the Alaska Native corporations as opposed to Native Villages and other actual tribal sovereigns and whether such business entities should ever have the same status of bona fide tribes.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., ruled in June that the corporations can be treated as tribal governments for limited purposes, in an initial victory for the U.S. Treasury Department. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The corporations have argued their roles are essential in supporting the more than 230 Alaska Native villages through employment opportunities, job training, scholarships, cultural preservation programs, land management and economic development.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“We hold strong our belief that Alaska Native people should not be punished for the unique tribal system that Congress established for the state 50 years ago,” the ANCSA Regional Association and the Alaska Native Village Corporation Association said in a statement on Friday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In a related matter, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit revived a case that the Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma filed against the Treasury Department over the initial disbursement of CARES Act funding to tribes based on population. The department relied on a formula used by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which showed the Shawnee and two dozen other tribes had no citizens. Each received the minimum $100,000 in relief funding.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Shawnee Tribe said its actual population is more than 3,000 and argued it was shortchanged by millions of dollars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mehta also heard that case and ruled that the Treasury Department has discretion in how it distributes the funding and, therefore, it wasn\'t subject to court review.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The appellate court has sent the case back to the district court for a ruling on the merits.\u003c/p>',

                        '\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. House pressed swiftly forward Tuesday toward impeachment or other steps to forcibly remove President Donald Trump from office, even as Trump blamed Democratic foes and not himself for last week\'s deadly attack on the Capitol.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He targeted the lawmakers who are pushing for his ouster, saying that it\'s “a really terrible thing that they’re doing.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“To continue on this path, I think it’s causing tremendous danger to our country, and it’s causing tremendous anger," he said. He accepted no blame for the Capitol attack and said, “I want no violence.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The defeated president, in his first remarks to reporters since last week’s violence, showed no remorse for firing up the crowd ahead of the the deadly invasion with comments that now are part of the impeachment charge of inciting insurrection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president spoke as he left for Texas to survey the border wall with Mexico, taking no questions, after the most serious and deadly domestic incursion at the Capitol in the nation’s history.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Impeachment ahead, the House on Tuesday will first try to convince the vice president and Cabinet to act even more quickly to remove Trump from office, warning he is a threat to democracy in the remaining days of his presidency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>House lawmakers are reconvening at the Capitol for the first time since the deadly pro-Trump riot to approve a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare the president unable to serve. Pence is not expected to take any such action. The House would next move swiftly to impeach Trump.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\'c1d0150957dc47aebc83fb67b4e8a78c\' class=\'media-placeholder\'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“We have to be very tough and very strong right now in defending the Constitution and democracy,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., an author of both pieces of legislation, in an interview.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump faces a single charge — “incitement of insurrection” — in the \u003ca href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7347691-Articles-of-impeachment-against-President-Trump.html">impeachment resolution\u003c/a> that the House will begin debating Wednesday, a week before Democrat Joe Biden is set to be inaugurated, Jan. 20. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The unprecedented events, only the first U.S. president to be twice impeached, are unfolding in a nation bracing for more unrest. The FBI has \u003ca>warned ominously of potential armed protests\u003c/a> in Washington and \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/state-capitols-security-e9fd42d72e7c0a150fd2dca9347be87d">many states \u003c/a> by Trump loyalists ahead of Biden’s inauguration. In a dark foreshadowing, the Washington Monument was closed to the public and the inauguration ceremony on the west steps of the Capitol will be off limits to the public.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It all added up to stunning final moments for Trump’s presidency as Democrats and a growing number of Republicans declare he is unfit for office and could do more damage after inciting a mob that violently ransacked the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="47921270-2e30-11eb-ee86-a56c9bb3ab33">\u003c/div>\u003cp>A Capitol police officer died from injuries suffered in the riot, and police shot a woman during the violence. Three others died in what authorities said were medical emergencies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Late Monday, the entire Congressional Hispanic Caucus, all 34 members, unanimously agreed to support impeachment, calling for Trump\'s immediate removal.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is clear that every moment Trump remains in office, America is at risk,” said a statement from the caucus, led by Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Ca. It said Trump "must be held accountable” for his actions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Democrats aren\'t the only ones who say Trump needs to go. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., spoke to House GOP colleagues late Monday of the significance of the vote, and encouraged them to consider it a “vote of conscience,” according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the private call. She has spoken critically of Trump\'s actions but has not said publicly how she will vote.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania joined GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska over the weekend in calling for Trump to “go away as soon as possible.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pence and Trump met late Monday for the first time since the Capitol attack, and had a “good conversation” pledging to continue working for the remainder of their terms, said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9894628968">Full Coverage: Politics\u003c/div>\u003cp>Pence has given no indication he would proceed with invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. No member of the Cabinet has publicly called for Trump to be removed from office through the 25th Amendment process.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As security tightened, Biden said Monday he was “not afraid” of taking the oath of office outside at the Capitol.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As for the rioters, Biden said, “It is critically important that there’ll be a real serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatening the lives, defacing public property, caused great damage -- that they be held accountable.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden said he’s had conversations with senators ahead of a possible impeachment trial, which some have worried would cloud the opening days of his administration. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer was exploring ways to immediately convene the Senate for the trial as soon as the House acts, though Republican leader Mitch McConnell would need to agree. The president-elect suggested splitting the Senate\'s time, perhaps “go a half day on dealing with impeachment, a half day on getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate, as well as moving on the package" for more COVID relief.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As Congress resumes, an uneasiness swept government. Another lawmaker, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., announced Tuesday she had tested positive for COVID-19 after sheltering during the siege. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Many lawmakers may choose to vote by proxy rather than come to Washington, a process that was put in place last year to limit the health risks of travel. \u003c/p>\u003cp>House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has discouraged GOP lawmakers from using the proxy option. But during a call with them he loosened his strict opposition for this week\'s votes, according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private call.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Among Trump\'s closest allies in Congress, McCarthy said in a letter to colleagues that “impeachment at this time would have the opposite effect of bringing our country together.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>He said he would review possible censure of the president. But House Republicans are split and a few may vote to impeach. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Democrats say they have the votes for impeachment. The impeachment bill from Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Ted Lieu of California, Raskin of Maryland and Jerrold Nadler of New York draws from Trump\'s own false statements about his election defeat to Biden. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Judges across the country, including some nominated by Trump, have repeatedly dismissed cases challenging the election results, and former Attorney General William Barr, a Trump ally, has said there was no sign of widespread fraud. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The impeachment legislation also details Trump\'s pressure on state officials in Georgia to “find” him more votes, as well as his White House rally ahead of the Capitol siege, in which he encouraged thousands of supporters last Wednesday to “fight like hell” and march to the building.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The mob overpowered police, broke through security lines and windows and rampaged through the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to scatter as they were finalizing Biden’s victory over Trump in the Electoral College. \u003c/p>\u003cp>While some have questioned impeaching the president so close to the end of his term, Democrats and others argue he must be prevented from holding future public office. \u003c/p>\u003cp>There is precedent for pursuing impeachment after an official leaves office. In 1876, during the Ulysses Grant administration, War Secretary William Belknap was impeached by the House the day he resigned, and the Senate convened a trial months later. He was acquitted.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Barrow reported from Wilmington, Delaware.

(AP) — The interior least tern, a hardy Midwestern bird that survived a craze for its plumage and dam-building that destroyed much of its habitat, has soared off the endangered species list.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Federal officials said Tuesday that 35 years of legal protection and habitat restoration efforts had brought the tern back from the brink of extinction.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Dozens of states, federal agencies, tribes, businesses and conservation groups have worked tirelessly over the course of three decades to successfully recover these birds,” U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Aurelia Skipwith said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The smallest members of the tern family, weighing less than 2 ounces (56 grams), they feed mostly on small fish and build nests on the ground. While most least terns are considered seabirds, some species live by rivers, lakes and wetlands.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="76a10180-2e30-11eb-b98f-4f785ee00f39">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Their most important nesting areas are along more than 2,800 miles (4,500 kilometers) of river channels in the Great Plains and the Lower Mississippi Valley.

Those structures wiped out much of the bird\'s shoreline habitat.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When listed as endangered in 1985 as a distinct population segment, fewer than 2,000 interior least terns remained, along with a few dozen nesting sites.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Army Corps of Engineers played a key role in the bird\'s recovery, changing river management strategies and placing dredged material to create new nesting and dwelling spots for terns and other imperiled shorebirds such as the piping plover.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The steps paid off. The interior least tern\'s population is now estimated at more than 18,000, with about 480 nesting sites available in 18 states.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Endangered Species Act requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to monitor the tern for at least five years to make sure its numbers remain stable.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The engineering changes have drawn criticism and legal action from some Missouri River farmers, who contend they have worsened flooding since the mid-2000s.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the Army Corps says it will continue conservation and monitoring efforts in an area affecting about 80% of the tern\'s breeding population.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Its partnership with other agencies and nonprofits has shown that “we can protect and recover an endangered species while continuing to provide critical navigation and flood control benefits to the nation,” said Major General Diana Holland, Commander of the Mississippi Valley Division of the Corps.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9882984017">Full Coverage: Wildlife\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Corps and the Fish and Wildlife Service teamed with the American Bird Conservancy to develop a computer modeling system to track the bird\'s status with and without continued management in certain areas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>States known to have colonies of the terns include: Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Environmental groups that sometimes have opposed dropping species from the endangered list supported the removal of the interior least tern.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We consider it an Endangered Species Act success story for sure,” said Noah Greenwald of the Center for Biological Diversity.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But he cautioned that vigilance was needed to make sure the bird\'s river habitat remains secure.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Scientists are warning that we\'re in danger of losing 1 million species to extinction," Greenwald said. “Efforts to manage rivers in a more natural way are the kinds of things we need to do to avoid the extinction crisis.”\u003c/p>',

Onetime Capitals goalie Braden Holtby is now in Vancouver. Blues captain \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-nhl-st-louis-blues-alex-pietrangelo-vegas-golden-knights-942a5d96dadb95afb1dac602d3212340">Alex Pietrangelo has left St. Louis\u003c/a> — where he was replaced by veteran Bruins defenseman Torey Krug — to hit the jackpot in Vegas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Staal wasn’t even the only member of his family on the move, with younger brother Marc traded from the Rangers to Detroit. And the Sabres made an even bigger splash in free agency by landing 2018 NHL MVP Taylor Hall in October.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On the west coast, Patrick Marleau is back in San Jose for a third stint in four years, while the Sharks’ lineup for the first time in 15 years will be without Joe Thornton, who is now in Toronto.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Just soak it all in,” said the 41-year-old Thornton, who grew up a 90-minute drive from Toronto. “I feel like I’m young again.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Though NHL stars switch teams every offseason, the moves this year were, in part, precipitated by the effects of COVID-19, which has frozen the salary cap at $81.5 million for at least this season and likely the next. That placed teams anticipating the cap to increase in a bind.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The effects were evident before free agency opened with teams not retaining the rights to some of their restricted free agents in fear of what the players might be awarded in salary arbitration hearings. That was the case in Buffalo, where the Sabres cut loose Dominik Kahun after the forward showed promise when playing six games after being acquired in a trade with Pittsburgh.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And while several players earned lucrative paydays in free agency, such as Pietrangelo, who signed a seven-year, $61.6 million contract, his deal proved to be an exception when it came to length.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hall, for example, \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-edmonton-oilers-nhl-edmonton-jack-eichel-efb3b2248a13bc6198b0cc269982a694">signed a one-year, $8 million deal\u003c/a> with Buffalo after realizing the free-agent market was going to be tight.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I came into it thinking that it was either going to be a six- or seven-year deal or a one-year deal, and see where the marketplace went to potentially next summer,” Hall said. “I don’t know if I’ll get there.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Tampa Bay, the defending champion \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/nikita-kucherov-tyler-johnson-alex-killorn-nhl-tampa-bay-lightning-7e2f1c684b4b3e5a488f2ba075ee7cfc">Lightning had to get creative\u003c/a> with their roster. \u003c/p>\u003cp>They lost defensemen Kevin Shattenkirk and Zach Bogosian to free agency and traded center Cedric Paquette and defenseman Braydon Coburn to Ottawa. The team acquired right wing Marian Gaborik and goalie Anders Nilsson from the Senators, but both will be placed on long-term injury reserve.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Oilers general manager Ken Holland chalked it up to the new economic realities facing the NHL.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s salary-cap related, which is related to the pandemic, which has given us a hard, flat cap for the foreseeable future,” Holland said. "The possibility of a flat cap for the next few years has a factor in all those factors.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>That left teams having to manage their caps by deciding whether it’s better to keep a high-priced veteran or fill the payroll slot with two lower-priced youngsters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s a reason why several established players were left to wait until training camps opened before being signed to professional tryout contracts, which don\'t count against the cap. They included defenseman Travis Hamonic (Vancouver), defenseman Michael Del Zotto (Columbus) and former Florida forward Mike Hoffman, who went on to sign a one-year, $4 million contract with St. Louis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Washington, defensemen John Carlson found it “definitely weird” not to see Holtby open camp between the pipes, saying, “I do miss him.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>And Krug was having difficulty envisioning the Bruins without Chara, while becoming familiar with his new surroundings in St. Louis after spending his first nine seasons in Boston.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s a different challenge,” Krug said. “From a personal standpoint, I pretty much could’ve done training camp in Boston blindfolded.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP Hockey Writers Stephen Whyno and Larry Lage contributed to this report.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL\u003c/p>',

                        '\u003cp>LAS VEGAS (AP) — Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire mogul, Republican mega-donor and power broker who built a casino empire spanning from Las Vegas to China and became a singular force in domestic and international politics, has died after a long illness. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson died at 87 from complications related to treatment for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Las Vegas Sands announced Tuesday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He was the son of Jewish immigrants raised in a Boston tenement who became one of the world’s richest men. The chairman and CEO of the Las Vegas Sands brought singing gondoliers to the Vegas Strip and foresaw the same potential in Asia. Forbes ranked him No. 19 in the U.S., worth an estimated $29.8 billion.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“If you do things differently, success will follow you like a shadow,” he said during a 2014 talk to the gambling industry in Las Vegas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Blunt yet secretive, the squatly-built Adelson resembled an old-fashioned political boss. He became one of the nation’s most influential GOP donors by setting records for individual contributions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2012, Politico called him “the dominant pioneer of the super PAC era.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson hosted the party’s top strategists and candidates at his modest office wedged among the casinos of the Las Vegas Strip. He helped ensure that uncritical support of Israel became a pillar of the GOP platform, never more visibly than when the Trump administration relocated the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The inflammatory move had been adamantly opposed by Palestinians and was long a priority for Adelson, who sat front and center at the ceremony in Jerusalem. with his wife, Miriam.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More recently, he reportedly purchased the U.S. ambassador’s official residence near Tel Aviv for some $67 million in a maneuver that appeared be aimed at preventing the embassy from relocating back to Tel Aviv after Trump leaves office. Just weeks ago, Adelson provided a private plane for Jonathan Pollard, a former U.S. intelligence analyst who spent 30 years in prison for spying for Israel, to move to Israel after his parole ended.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="db712c40-2e30-11eb-e0d8-c3209b64f6fc">\u003c/div>\u003cp>When asked at a gambling conference what he hoped his legacy would be, Adelson said it wasn’t his glitzy casinos or hotels but his impact in Israel. He was closely aligned with the conservative Likud party and funded a widely-read free daily newspaper called “Israel Hayom,” or “Israel Today,” so supportive of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that some Israelis nicknamed it “Bibi-ton,” a play on words combining Netanyahu\'s nickname with the Hebrew word for newspaper. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In the U.S., Adelson helped underwrite congressional trips to Israel, helped build a new headquarters for the lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and later was a top supporter of the Israeli-American Council, whose conferences have attracted top Republicans (Vice President Mike Pence) and Democrats (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi).\u003c/p>\u003cp>His attachment to Israel was life-long and so deep that he once said he wished his military service had been in an Israeli uniform instead of an American one.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/sheldon-adelson-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-9e6fb531f3ac4f52a16e0d12bad5f833">said Tuesday\u003c/a> that Adelson “will forever be remembered” for his work strengthening ties between the U.S. and Israel.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson was a late bloomer in business and in politics. He didn’t become a casino owner, or a Republican, until well into middle age. Through the 1990s and after his wealth soared, his engagement in politics intensified. He was a supporter of President George W. Bush and backed Republican Rudolph Giuliani for the 2008 presidential race, before turning to the eventual candidate, Sen. John McCain, who lost to Barack Obama.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Sheldon battled his way out of a tough Boston neighborhood to build a successful enterprise that loyally employed tens of thousands - and entertained millions," said Bush in a prepared statement Tuesday. “He was an American patriot.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson\'s leverage grew considerably in 2010 after the Supreme Court’s “Citizens United” decision lifted many restrictions on individual campaign contributions. He and his wife spent more than $90 million on the 2012 election, funding presidential candidate Newt Gingrich and later Mitt Romney.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m against very wealthy people attempting to or influencing elections,” he told Forbes magazine in 2012. “But as long as it’s doable I’m going to do it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson came around slowly to Trump, who ridiculed Adelson\'s support for Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, tweeting in 2015, “Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!” \u003c/p>\u003cp>But after Trump’s surprise victory, the new president spoke often with Adelson and embraced his hardline views on the Middle East. He cut funding for Palestinian refugees and withdrew from the Obama administration’s nuclear nonproliferation deal with Iran. He bucked long-held and bipartisan U.S. policy that viewed Jerusalem as key to any peace agreement with the Palestinians. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson, in turn, aided Trump financially, including $5 million for his inauguration, and supported him through his media holdings. Late in 2015, Adelson secretly purchased the Las Vegas Review-Journal — the paper’s own reporters revealed he was the new owner. Some longtime staffers left in protest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In what was widely seen as a mark of the Adelsons’ influence with Trump, Miriam Adelson was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9894828501">Full Coverage: Sheldon Adelson\u003c/div>\u003cp>Adelson, who contributed more than $100 million to the 2018 off-year elections, held extraordinary power among Republicans even though he didn’t always agree with them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our nation lost a remarkable American with the passing of my friend Sheldon Adelson," said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In a 2012 interview with The Wall Street Journal, he called himself “basically a social liberal,” who was pro-choice on abortion and supportive of immigrant rights. He cited taxes and differences over Israel as major reasons for leaving the Democratic party.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“His life made him a fearless advocate for freedom and entrepreneurship and a source of counsel and support to a generation of conservatives, including me,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Nevada, his influence was such that even the state’s most prominent Democrat, Sen. Harry Reid, hesitated to take him on. In a 2014 interview with MSNBC, the then-Senate majority leader differentiated between Adelson and fellow GOP billionaire donors Charles and David Koch. Reid had sharply criticized the Koch brothers as callous and greedy, while saying that he respected Adelson because he was “not in it to make money,” a widely challenged opinion. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“In the nearly four decades that I’ve known him, Sheldon Adelson has been outspoken with causes important to him," Reid said Tuesday. “His advocacy for the state of Israel and Jewish causes was without equal and made a difference in countless lives both at home and abroad.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson was married twice. He and his first wife, Sandra, were divorced in 1988. Three years later, he married Miriam Farbstein-Ochshorn, an Israeli-born doctor he met on a blind date and whom many believe helped deepen his involvement with Israel. Their honeymoon trip to Venice inspired Adelson to raze the historic Sands hotel-casino, once a favorite hangout for Frank Sinatra among others, and replaced it with a pair of massive complexes: The Venetian and The Palazzo, one of the city’s tallest buildings.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson led efforts to move the NFL Raiders team from Oakland, California, to Las Vegas and his decision during pandemic to keep his casino employees in Las Vegas paid and insured despite closures and business slowing for casinos. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“That commitment helped keep thousands of Nevadans afloat during the most difficult of months, and Sheldon’s commitment will never be forgotten,” said Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sheldon Adelson adopted his first wife’s three children and had two children with his second wife. Among numerous philanthropic projects, he and Miriam Adelson were especially committed to the research and treatment of substance abuse, a personal cause for Sheldon Adelson. His son Mitchell, from his first marriage, died of an overdose in 2005. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sheldon Garry Adelson was born in 1933, in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. His father was a taxi driver, his mother the manager of a knitting store. A natural entrepreneur, he was selling newspapers by age 12 and running a vending machine business at 16. After dropping out of City College of New York and serving in the Army, he attempted to start dozens of small businesses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adelson, who said he disdained email, began to amass his fortune with a technology trade show, starting computer convention COMDEX in 1979 before selling his stake in 1995 for more than $800 million. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When he bought the Sands Hotel in 1989, he was thinking convention space, not just gambling, would make money. It did. He built a convention hall to keep his hotel rooms full on weekdays and others soon followed the business model. Meanwhile, he worked to replicate the Strip in Macao, the only place in China where casino gambling is legal, and his wealth grew exponentially.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When faced with water and marsh land, Adelson directed his company to build land where there wasn’t any, piling sand up to create the Cotai Peninsula. Soon his Macao revenue outstripped that of his Las Vegas holdings. He later expanded his business to Singapore, where his Marina Bay Sands hotel and its infinity pool were featured in the film “Crazy Rich Asians,” and had been pressing to open a casino in Japan.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His Macao business also spawned a long-running wrongful termination lawsuit brought by a former chief of Sands China Ltd. who accused Adelson and the company of firing him for exposing a host of misdeeds. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Sands China lawsuit was among dozens involving Adelson, whose cases included his suing a Wall Street Journal reporter for calling him “foul-mouthed” (the parties settled, the words remained) to being sued by his sons from his first marriage for cheating them out of money (he won).\u003c/p>\u003cp>A long-running feud with fellow casino tycoon Steve Wynn turned to friendship when Wynn joined Adelson’s effort to end online gambling. Critics said Adelson was trying to stifle competition. Adelson countered that there was no way to ensure children and teenagers wouldn’t gamble and said he was “not in favor of it exploiting the world’s most vulnerable people.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump’s election would again prove useful to Adelson. During the Obama administration, the Justice Department said online gambling that does not involve sporting events would not violate the Wire Act, a 1961 federal statute. In a legal opinion that became public early in 2019, the department reversed itself and decided the statute applies to any form of gambling.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writers Michelle L. Price and Ken Ritter in Las Vegas, Zeke Miller and Alan Fram in Washington, Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report. \u003c/p>',

Footpaths are lined with Japanese-style vintage lanterns, and plants such as azaleas, bamboo, camellias and star magnolias. Trees include cherry blossoms and gingko; an antique Buddha statue along one path serenely holds a floral offering beneath a Japanese maple. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>A viewing deck and footbridge cross a koi pond with lotuses. The open-air pavilion, built next to a waterfall, offers a peaceful space for contemplation with a view of the dry garden\'s raked sand, rocks and boulders, with a reflective pond and wide expanse of garden beyond. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Lotusland\'s gardens were created on a 37-acre estate about 100 miles north of Los Angeles by Ganna Walska, an eccentric Polish opera singer and spiritual seeker. They opened to the public in 1993. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For the 1.5-acre Japanese garden, she worked with Lotusland gardener Frank Fujii beginning in the late 1960s. They and stone mason Oswald Da Ros selected stones, lanterns and plants. Fujii continued the work after Walska’s passing in 1984 until his retirement in 2007. Also on the project was Koichi Kawana, a lecturer at UCLA who specialized in Japanese garden design. His contributions included a Shinto-style shrine added to the garden in a new grove of conifers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Changes in the recent renovation included a new pond, a viewing deck for a closer experience of the koi and lotuses, and handicapped-accessible footpaths and bridges. Some plants and trees were added, and others replaced. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For visitors, advance reservations are required.\u003c/p>',

                        "\u003cp>There's an iconic photograph of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that was taken as he triumphantly boarded one of the first integrated buses in Montgomery, Alabama. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It was 1956 and King looks out a window, firmly at the front of the bus, almost gazing toward his movement's next big social hurdle. The image was taken by Ernest Withers, a key chronicler of the civil rights movement — and an FBI informant.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That the FBI wanted someone close and watching King is at the heart of director Sam Pollard's engrossing documentary \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lvfxzht9KUA\">“MLK/FBI,”\u003c/a> a film that artfully explains how the two sides of that slash came to be enemies.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Pollard is a veteran producer and filmmaker who co-directed two episodes of “Eyes on the Prize” and earned an Oscar nomination for editing Spike Lee’s blistering 1997 film “4 Little Girls.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In “MLK/FBI,” Pollard explains how J. Edgar Hoover used the full force of his federal law enforcement agency to attack a progressive, nonviolent cause. That included wiretaps, blackmail and informers, trying to find dirt on King. “I think this entire episode represents the darkest part of the Bureau’s history,” notes former FBI Director James Comey. \u003c/p>\u003cp>There is nothing terribly new in the telling, no huge revelations or bombshells. Most of the details — including King's infidelity and the use of Withers as an FBI informant — have been known for years. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But that's not Pollard's interest. His canvas is large, stretching back to post-Civil War Jim Crow, exploring how notions of Black sexuality were turned into social weapons and into the way FBI agents were made mythical in popular culture.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pollard is patient and thoughtful, leaning his film on David J. Garrow’s book “The FBI and Martin Luther King Jr.: From ‘Solo’ to Memphis.” The most salacious stuff must wait until three-quarters through, until the filmmaker has pulled all the historical threads together. Then the picture is clear — and frightening.\u003c/p>\u003cp>King's famous March on Washington took place on Aug. 28, 1963, and two days later, in a memo, William C. Sullivan, the head of FBI domestic intelligence, wrote, “We must mark him now as the most dangerous Negro in the future of this Nation,” adding, “and we must use every resource as our disposal to destroy him.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>There are lessons for 2021, for sure. Having Communist leanings in the ‘50s and ’60s was as smeared as the socialism of today. “I Am a Man” placards at protests echo the “Black Lives Matter” signs of today. White America’s anxieties around Black empowerment have not changed much.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“MLK/FBI” has a different feel than traditional documentaries, eschewing the usual pattern of old footage punctuated by talking heads, in favor of just footage and soaring songs, like “Lord Don’t Move the Mountain” by Mahalia Jackson and “Oh Freedom” by Harry Belafonte.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pollard has interviewed historians, journalists and participants but we mostly only hear them. That means the commentary of someone like Andrew Young — a civil rights hero himself, a King confidant and longtime politician — gets mixed in and on par with a historian who has no first-hand knowledge. Something about that is off.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The director also weaves in scenes from old pulpy movies like “Walk a Crooked Mile,” “Big Jim McLean” and “I Was a Communist for the FBI,” as well as newsreels with booming voices and soaring music. Somehow they strike an odd note juxtaposed with intimate King home movies and news footage of bloodied Black men and women being hauled away by cops.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The film is ultimately crippled by something out of the makers' control. We are told that after the FBI makes a salacious tape and sends it to King's wife, King “undergoes a real emotional crisis. And it’s an emotional crisis that the FBI is listening in on.” But we can't listen to any of it. All surveillance tapes are under seal and the earliest they can be released is 2027.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pollard also offers threads of interesting avenues only lightly explored, like what happens when those secret King recordings are made public. Some feel that historians may be complicit if they investigate information that they shouldn’t have in the first place. And Hoover's personal life as a motive for his anger at King is only lightly described.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But those are questions for another time. For now, watch “MLK/FBI” and marvel at how a man could inspire so much and keep his cool while a vise was closing all around him.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“MLK/FBI,” an IFC Films release, is not rated but has footage of bloodied protesters and descriptions of sex, including rape. Running time: 102 minutes. Three stars out of four. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___ \u003c/p>\u003cp>Online: https://www.ifcfilms.com/films/mlk-fbi\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mark Kennedy is at \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits\">http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits\u003c/a>\u003c/p>",

Maybe it’s because there are no fans in most arenas, maybe it’s because teams are tired from playing with a bit less rest than they’ve gotten in recent years or maybe it’s because the strains of a COVID-19 world are weighing heavily on players.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s probably a combination of all that and more.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the numbers are also quite a bit overwhelming: The average margin of victory right now in the NBA, about 12.3 points per game, is on pace to be the largest in league history. And the rate of teams going up by 30 or more points — it\'s happened in 20% of games played so far — smashes what has been the norm even in this 3-point-wild, faster-paced era of NBA play.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“This is going to be the craziest NBA season ever,” Brooklyn coach Steve Nash said. “We’ve already seen some incredible scores and oddities and so I think just trying to just be adaptive and continue to work through things and learn through your games as much as anything rather than practices is just essential.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Last season, one NBA team took a 30-point lead on the other 10% of the time. The season before that, 2018-19, that rate was 11%. The year before that, 9%.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Milwaukee has played 11 games and held 30-point leads in four of them; the Bucks only got to a 25-point margin in their win over Orlando on Monday. The Los Angeles Clippers have played 11 games; they’ve either led or trailed by at least 20 points in eight of those, including the biggest deficit in the NBA so far this season — 57 points against Dallas on Dec. 27.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The only teams in the NBA that haven’t led by even 20 points yet this season? Chicago, Minnesota, Oklahoma City and Sacramento. The only team that hasn’t been down by 20 yet? Indiana. Every other team has been in a very, very deep hole at least once so far this season — and Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon isn’t shy about calling first-year coach Nate Bjorkgren a great one. Say this much for Bjorkgren: He\'s had the Pacers in every game, no small feat in this era.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think this organization has been slept on for years now,” Brogdon said last month. “I think it’s time for people to wake up.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s not like every night this season has seen nothing but blowouts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Monday was the 20th day of games this season; of those days, nine have seen multiple games decided by three points or fewer, most recently a pair of such games Sunday. A glaring exception, though, was the five-game showcase lineup on Christmas Day — where the closest final margin was 13 points. That was the first time since 2006 that the NBA had no single-digit games on Christmas, and it must be noted that year had Miami’s 16-point win over the Los Angeles Lakers as the lone game on the Dec. 25 slate.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>And games have tightened up a bit in recent days; in the week from Dec. 29 through Jan. 4, 15 of the 56 NBA games had one team enjoying a 30-point lead, and in the week that followed and ended Monday, only eight of 53 games had such a margin at any point. Maybe that’s a sign that teams are getting into better shape, a real possibility after a truncated training camp and shortened preseason.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When you keep that competitive spirit up, it spreads throughout the group,” San Antonio guard Patty Mills said. “It’s contagious.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Who knows where the scoring will go in the next few days and weeks, amid the pandemic that has forced the NBA to postpone games that were on the schedule for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. The ripple effects of contact-tracing results will be felt in Dallas, Miami and other cities for the next several days at least.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Like Nash said, the craziest NBA season ever awaits, on the scoreboards and off.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And it’s just getting started.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tim Reynolds is a national basketball writer for The Associated Press.

Then GM will roll out a clean electric delivery van.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The pallet, named EP1, will go on sale early this year, with the EV600 van on the roads late in the year with 500 going to FedEx, the company's first customer.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>BrightDrop also will offer software and operational support for delivery businesses such as location services, battery status and remote unlocking.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But GM doesn't intend to get into the delivery business, said Pamela Fletcher, GM's vice president of global innovation. “One thing we are not is a logistics company,” she said, adding that GM is working with many companies with experience in the field.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Since late 2018, Fletcher, has been in charge of monetizing GM technology by turning ideas into businesses. “We really need to leverage our electrification expertise to other industries,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Showing Wall Street’s fascination with electric vehicles, GM shares rose to their highest intraday price since the company left bankruptcy protection in 2010. Shares were up 4.9% to $47.23 in midday trading Tuesday after trading as high as $48.95.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fletcher wouldn't comment on whether BrightDrop products would be sold through existing GM dealerships or directly by the company. But spokesman Stuart Fowle the company is working with its independent dealers on a separate BrightDrop sales network, with details to come later. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On a webcast, Fletcher said the EP1 pallet can travel up to 3 mph, carrying up to 23 cubic feet of cargo weighing up to 200 pounds. The pallets can reduce the strain on workers but would not operate autonomously, at least to start.\u003c/p>\u003cp>They're already being tested with FedEx, allowing workers to transport 25% more packages per day, GM said in a statement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The EV600 van will have a range of up to 250 miles when fully charged, Fletcher said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As BrightDrop evolves, it will offer more electric-powered products including a medium-distance vehicle that can carry multiple pallets, the company said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>GM CEO Mary Barra announced BrightDrop in a keynote address address as part of the virtual CES gadget show on Tuesday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>She said some countries have set limits on petroleum-powered delivery vehicles to fight pollution at a time when the coronavirus has brought dramatic increases in packages. “The pandemic has only accelerated those challenges as this sector became our lifeline to goods and services we could no longer access in person,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>During its CES presentation, GM even showed a video a four-rotor autonomous flying Cadillac pod concept vehicle. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Fletcher said she expects BrightDrop to contribute to GM's bottom line very quickly after its products go on sale. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Last year, Ford Motor Co., GM's main U.S. competitor, announced plans for an electric commercial van that will go on sale late in 2021.\u003c/p>\u003cp>GM has pledged to roll out 30 new electric vehicles globally and spend $27 billion developing them by 2025. New vehicles coming out this year include the electric GMC Hummer pickup, a Chevrolet Bolt electric utility vehicle and the Cadillac Lyriq luxury SUV. \u003c/p>",

The Masters does not publicize how many tickets it sells or how many people typically are on the grounds. It has been estimated at roughly 40,000, though it's far easier to judge the attendance in volume decibels.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The roars are a big part of what makes the Masters, and they were missing in November when Dustin Johnson set the scoring record at 20-under 268 to win by five shots for his first green jacket.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The club is so confident that Ridley also said the Augusta National Women's Amateur, which was canceled last year after its debut in 2019, and the Drive, Chip and Putt National Finals, will be held with a small number of spectators.\u003c/p>",

Young mothers and their sons and daughters paid a terrible price for that dysfunction,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Martin said he would make a formal apology on behalf of the state in Ireland\'s parliament on Wednesday.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The final report of an inquiry into the mother-and-baby homes said that 9,000 children died in 18 different mother and baby homes during the 20th century. Fifteen percent of all children born in the homes died, almost double the nationwide infant mortality rate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The report said “the very high mortality rates were known to local and national authorities at the time and were recorded in official publications.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The inquiry is part of a process of reckoning in overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Ireland with a history of abuses in church-run institutions, including the shunning and shaming of unwed mothers, many of whom were pressured into giving up babies for adoption.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Church-run homes in Ireland housed orphans, unmarried pregnant women and their babies for most of the 20th century. The institutions have been subject to intense public scrutiny since historian in 2014 Catherine Corless tracked down death certificates for nearly 800 children who died at the former Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway in western Ireland -- but could only find a burial record for one child.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Investigators later found a mass grave containing remains of babies and young children in an underground sewage structure on the grounds of the home, which was run by an order of Catholic nuns and closed in 1961\u003c/p>\u003cp>The commission of inquiry said about 56,000 unmarried mothers and about 57,000 children had lived in the homes it investigated, with the greatest number of admissions in the 1960s and early 1970s. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The last of the homes did not shut until 1998.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“While mother and baby homes were not a peculiarly Irish phenomenon, the proportion of Irish unmarried mothers who were admitted to mother and baby homes or county homes in the 20th century was probably the highest in the world,” the report said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The commission said that the women’s lives “were blighted by pregnancy outside marriage, and the responses of the father of their child, their immediate families and the wider community.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The vast majority of children in the institutions were ‘illegitimate’ and, because of this, suffered discrimination for most of their lives,” the report added.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The prime minister said the report “presents all of Irish society with profound questions.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“What has been described in this report wasn’t imposed on us by any foreign power,” he said. “We did this to ourselves, as a society. “\u003c/p>',

Despite the December numbers, Boeing’s full-year numbers for 2020 still declined from 2019.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Boeing finished 2020 with 157 deliveries, including planes handed over to cargo airlines and military customers. That was down from 380 deliveries in 2019. European rival Airbus finished the year with 566 deliveries.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Deliveries are crucial because aircraft makers get much of their cash when planes are delivered. Short on cash during the Max grounding, Boeing has borrowed billions and cut thousands of jobs to reduce costs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Federal Aviation Administration's decision in November to approve changes to a flight-control system on the Max allowed Boeing to resume shipping previously built Maxes to airline customers. Boeing delivered 39 planes in December, including 28 Maxes, of which 10 went to American Airlines and eight to United Airlines.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Boeing reported 90 new orders in December. The bulk, 75, came in a single previously announced order by Irish discount airline Ryanair. The total included cargo carrier DHL's order for eight Boeing 777 freighters, which was announced Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>However, Boeing also reported canceled orders for 105 Max planes, all but five by leasing companies that fear it will be difficult to find operators to take the planes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The totals don't include Alaska Airlines' decision to buy 23 more Max jets. That deal was announced last month but will be reported with January orders, a Boeing spokesman said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For 2020, orders fell to 184 from 246 in 2019.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Airbus reported 383 orders in 2020.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Boeing said it has a backlog of nearly 3,300 unfilled orders for the Max and about 4,200 for all planes, including cargo freighters.\u003c/p>",

                        "\u003cp>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian navy divers searching the ocean floor on Tuesday recovered the flight data recorder from a Sriwijaya Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea with 62 people on board. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The device is expected to help investigators determine what caused the Boeing 737-500 to nosedive into the ocean in heavy rain shortly after taking off from Jakarta on Saturday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The 26-year-old jet had been out of service for almost nine months because of flight cutbacks caused by the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. It resumed commercial flights last month. \u003c/p>\u003cp>TV stations showed divers on an inflatable raft with a large white container containing the flight data recorder heading to a Jakarta port. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Military chief Air Chief Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto said the plane’s other “black box,” the cockpit voice recorder, was likely to be found soon because its beacon was being emitted in the same area.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The devices were buried in seabed mud under tons of sharp objects in the plane's wreckage, navy Chief Adm. Yudo Margono said. He said at least 160 divers were deployed Tuesday in the search.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More than 3,600 rescue personnel, 13 helicopters, 54 large ships and 20 small boats are searching the area just north of Jakarta where Flight 182 crashed and have found parts of the plane and human remains in the water at a depth of 23 meters (75 feet).\u003c/p>\u003cp>So far, the searchers have sent 74 body bags containing human remains to police identification experts who on Monday said they had identified their first victim, 29-year-old flight attendant Okky Bisma.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His wife, Aldha Refa, who is also a flight attendant for Sriwijaya Air, shared her grief in a series of posts on social media.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“My husband is a loving, devout and super kind man,” she wrote on Instagram. “Heaven is your place, dear ... be peaceful there.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Anguished family members have been providing samples for DNA tests, and the National Police disaster victim identification unit said it has identified three more victims, including the co-pilot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The chairman of Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee, Soerjanto Tjahjono, ruled out a possible midair breakup after seeing the condition of the wreckage found by searchers. He said the jet was intact until it struck the water, concentrating the debris field, rather than spreading it out over a large area as would be seen with a midair event. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Tjahjono said the plane continued to send altitude data until it descended to 250 feet (75 meters) above the water’s surface.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As in many countries, Indonesia's aviation industry has been badly hit by the pandemic, with travel restrictions and sharp declines in passengers. According to Transportation Ministry data, the jet didn’t fly from March 23 to Dec. 19.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration sent an airworthiness directive requiring operators of various Boeing 737 aircraft models, including the 737-500, to carry out engine checks before they can be flown again after being out of service, Director General of Air Transportation Novie Riyanto said in a statement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He said the plane was inspected on Dec. 2, including checks for engine corrosion, and was declared airworthy by the Transportation Ministry on Dec. 14. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The plane made an initial flight without passengers on Dec. 19 and resumed commercial flights on Dec. 22, according to ministry data.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The disaster has reignited concerns about safety in the aviation industry, which grew quickly after the economy was opened following the fall of dictator Suharto in the late 1990s. The United States banned Indonesian carriers from operating in the country in 2007, lifting the action in 2016, citing improvements in compliance with international aviation standards. The European Union lifted a similar ban in 2018.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sriwijaya Air has had only minor safety incidents in the past, though a farmer was killed in 2008 when a plane went off the runway while landing due to a hydraulic issue. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2018, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 jet operated by Lion Air crashed, killing 189 people. An automated flight-control system played a role in that crash, but the Sriwijaya Air jet did not have that system on board.\u003c/p>",

                        '\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s days in office are numbered. But he’s already stopped doing much of his job.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the last three weeks, a bomb went off in a major city and the president said nothing about it. The coronavirus surged to horrifying new levels of illness and death in the U.S. without Trump acknowledging the awful milestones. A violent mob incited by the president\'s own words chanted for Mike Pence\'s lynching at the U.S. Capitol and Trump made no effort to reach out to his vice president. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump only belatedly ordered flags flown at half-staff to honor an officer who gave his life defending the Capitol, and couldn’t be bothered to describe the officer’s actions. On Tuesday, he denied any responsibility for fomenting the insurrection at the Capitol and said his remarks to supporters who stormed the building in events that took the lives of five people, including a Capitol Police officer, were “totally appropriate.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The transgressions, big and small — of norms, of leadership, of basic decency — cast a pall over his final days in office, and, in the view of even close advisers speaking privately, have indelibly stained his legacy. A half-dozen current administration officials expressed dismay at the president\'s action\'s in recent weeks, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they are still working for Trump.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Even after losing the election, President Trump had the opportunity to leave the White House with his head held high, celebrating achievements like the COVID-19 vaccine, progress in the Middle East, and the vibrant pre-pandemic economy fueled by tax reform,” said GOP operative Michael Steel, a onetime aide to former House Speaker John Boehner.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="c5515fd0-2e30-11eb-8f1b-c718e688e42f">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Instead, he chose to wallow in delusion and grievance, and — as a result — the defining images of his presidency will be a bloody, murderous mob looting the cathedral of our democracy, the United States Capitol," Steel said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As the violence raged at the Capitol last Wednesday, Trump only reluctantly put out a pair of tweets appealing for calm at the insistence of aides, as well as a video seemingly excusing the events that included this Trump message to the rioters: “We love you. You’re very special.”. He followed it up with a presidential video on Thursday decrying the violence, apparently hoping to ward off potential legal exposure and efforts to remove him from office. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Now, as the FBI warns of armed protests across the nation and in Washington in the days leading up to President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, Trump has said nothing in recent days to tamp down passions or ensure his supporters do not again resort to violence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the same time, Trump has continued to spread lies about election fraud, about his political opponent and about members of his own party. After the Nov. 3 vote, he retreated into a bunker of his own delusion, unable or unwilling to concede defeat, and dragged millions with him.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Two months later, aides are still struggling to convince Trump to make an effort to showcase and salvage his achievements in office, with limited success. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He agreed to travel to Texas on Tuesday to view the U.S.-Mexico border wall one final time in office. But he has yet to sign off on a proposal from aides for him to deliver remarks in his final week in office highlighting the development of coronavirus vaccines and his efforts to boost military funding. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It remains unlikely that Trump will deliver a farewell speech before leaving office, a tradition for departing presidents.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump\'s actions have cost him his megaphone, as social media companies suspended him from their platforms citing his provocative rhetoric. But Trump has made little effort to get his voice back, avoiding television interviews and interactions with reporters.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9906208245">Full Coverage: Politics\u003c/div>\u003cp>Instead, Trump has been stewing inside the White House, alternating between his private dining room off the Oval Office and the mansion’s residence level, never far from a television set. Without Twitter or Facebook, he’s used his phone to call an ever-shrinking circle of aides and allies to claim the role of the aggrieved.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Since the holidays, Trump has dictated that his daily public schedule — virtually devoid of any public events — include a bizarre affirmation that he is indeed on the job. “President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The guidance has become a punchline in the White House, and close aides say it belies the truth: Trump effectively ceased acting like the president after the election, with his inability to focus on almost anything other than his defeat growing more pronounced as the weeks have passed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump has not had an intelligence briefing on his schedule in months — though aides say he has sat for them sporadically. As the coronavirus has killed more than 375,000 Americans in the last year, he has done little publicly or privately to try to manage the raging pandemic. And weeks after one of the largest infiltrations of U.S. government computer networks was pinned on Russia, Trump\'s main response was to suggest it could have been China.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As Trump obsesses over his election loss and many of his defenders fade away, it has largely fallen to his dwindling cadre of White House aides to defend his record over the past four years and offer assurances the president is still on the job.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“President Trump has rolled back government regulations, built the strongest, most inclusive economy in history, brought much-needed agency accountability, is bringing our troops home, developed a safe, effective vaccine in record time, and changed the way domestic and international deal-making is done so that the results actually help hardworking Americans,” said Trump spokesman Judd Deere. “This important work continues along with rebuilding our economy and fulfilling the promises he made that has led to a safer, stronger, more secure America.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump himself has made little effort lately to make that argument.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>EDITOR’S NOTE — Zeke Miller has covered the White House for The Associated Press since 2017.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.\u003c/p>',

                        "\u003cp>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The International Space Station bid adieu Tuesday to 12 bottles of French Bordeaux wine and hundreds of snippets of grapevines that spent a year orbiting the world in the name of science.\u003c/p>\u003cp>SpaceX’s Dragon cargo capsule undocked with the wine and vines — and thousands of pounds of other gear and research, including mice — and aimed for a splashdown Wednesday night in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Tampa. The Atlantic had been targeted, but poor weather shifted the arrival to Florida's other side. SpaceX's supply ships previously parachuted into the Pacific.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The carefully packed wine — each bottle nestled inside a steel cylinder to prevent breakage — remained corked aboard the orbiting lab. Space Cargo Unlimited, a Luxembourg startup behind the experiments, wanted the wine to age for an entire year up there. \u003c/p>\u003cp>None of the bottles will be opened until the end of February. That’s when the company will pop open a bottle or two for an out-of-this-world wine tasting in Bordeaux by some of France’s top connoisseurs and experts. Months of chemical testing will follow. Researchers are eager to see how space altered the sedimentation and bubbles.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Agricultural science is the primary objective, stresses Nicolas Gaume, the company’s CEO and co-founder, although he admits it will be fun to sample the wine. He’ll be among the lucky few taking a sip.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='c2fd5e26a0fe4424807fc08125df9a6e' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Our goal is to tackle the solution of how we’re going to have an agriculture tomorrow that is both organic and healthy and able to feed humanity, and we think space has the key,” Gaume said from Bordeaux. \u003c/p>\u003cp>With climate change, Gaume said agricultural products like grapes will need to adapt to harsher conditions. Through a series of space experiments, Space Cargo Unlimited hopes to take what’s learned by stressing the plants in weightlessness and turn that into more robust and resilient plants on Earth. \u003c/p>\u003cp>There's another benefit. Gaume expects future explorers to the moon and Mars will want to enjoy some of Earth's pleasures. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Being French, it's part of life to have some good food and good wine,” he told The Associated Press.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gaume said private investors helped fund the experiments. He declined to provide the project cost.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The wine hitched a ride to the space station in November 2019 aboard a Northrop Grumman supply ship. The 320 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon vine snippets, called canes in the grape-growing business, were launched by SpaceX last March. \u003c/p>\u003cp>SpaceX is the only shipper capable of returning space station experiments and other items intact. The other cargo capsules are filled with trash and burn up when reentering Earth's atmosphere.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Layoffs, however, soared 17.6% to 1.9 million, driven mostly by job cuts at restaurants, bars and hotels, which more than doubled. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The economy is likely to grow at a healthier pace later this year, economists forecast, as vaccines are more widely distributed and recent government stimulus provides more money for Americans to spend. The faster growth should boost hiring, but most employers for now appear to be in wait-and-see mode. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Friday, the \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-economy-ad4cb9fe70653c56ac6253aaab210f21">Labor Department said\u003c/a> employers cut 140,000 jobs in December, the first time the nation has shed jobs since April when U.S. infections began to surge. The unemployment rate was stuck at a still-high 6.7%, the first time it hasn\'t declined since April. Jobs lost according to that report were also highly concentrated in fields like educational services and film production, as well as already suffering restaurants and hotels. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Tuesday’s report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, adds more details about hiring and firing by businesses and government agencies. The data on open jobs provides insights into whether companies expect business to improve enough in coming months to justify additional hiring. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Last week, job postings website \u003ca href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/01/06/job-postings-through-dec-31/">Indeed said\u003c/a> that while companies listed more jobs in December, the pace had slowed from previous months. \u003c/p>\u003cp>While layoffs have been concentrated in mostly lower-paying jobs, Indeed\'s data shows that job postings have declined by a larger amount for the highest paying one-third of positions, and by the least for the lowest-paying third. That also suggests firms are still uncertain about the business outlook and reluctant to commit to hiring higher-paid employees. \u003c/p>',

                        '\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — In moments of crisis, of war and terror, of loss and mourning, American leaders have sought to utter words to match the moment in hope that the power of oratory can bring order to chaos and despair.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lincoln at Gettysburg. Franklin Roosevelt during the Depression and World War II. Reagan after the Challenger disaster. Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing. George W. Bush with a bullhorn at Ground Zero in 2001 and Barack Obama after the slaughter of congregants at a South Carolina church.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Each time, the speakers, Republican and Democrat, extemporaneously or with a script, managed to sound notes that brought at least a temporary sense of national unity and purpose.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I really think there is something at the very core of our humanity that only words can satisfy,” said Wayne Fields, author of “Union of Words: A History of Presidential Eloquence," and a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. “Almost as much as our need to be touched in the most desperate of circumstances is our need to be spoken to. Public despair in particular has to be literally addressed, I think, if it is to be overcome, must be articulated and then transcended.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the aftermath of a \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/78104aea082995bbd7412a6e6cd13818">violent insurrection\u003c/a> at the U.S. Capitol, a cathedral of democracy, President Donald Trump did not meet that prescription. He scaled the walls of false equivalency and descended into the canyons of conspiracy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He stirred the riotous mob with his “fight like hell” speech before his supporters marched to the Capitol, then delivered a tepid appeal for nonviolence, telling his supporters he loved them. This came well after the man voters chose to succeed him, President-elect Joe Biden, had summoned outrage, empathy and a sense of a path forward.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="6d0d8b90-2e30-11eb-89a8-654344ec0171">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Trump has never been much for the big speech. Those he has given, like his Oval Office address about the pandemic in March, contained more than one large error. His preferred medium was Twitter, where his 280-characters-at-a-time rhetoric was a study in hortatory rather than oratory. And by Friday, Twitter had \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-coronavirus-pandemic-david-letterman-reality-tv-8551982a4c79c8f3825834ef86586d5b">shut down his account\u003c/a> permanently.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The oratory of crisis typically consists of either a formal statement or an extemporaneous speech. Bush’s initial speech after 9/11 was not particularly well received. But his appearance in the rubble of the World Trade Center bombing was considered one of his finest moments, in which he found just the right words when speaking to rescue workers who said, “I can\'t hear you.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Using a bullhorn, Bush responded: “I can hear you! I can hear you! The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Other presidents have made more direct appeals for healing. Ronald Reagan, poised to deliver a State of the Union address, had to pivot to address the national tragedy of the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, and the loss of its crew of seven, including the teacher Christa McAuliffe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen," Reagan said. "It’s all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It’s all part of taking a chance and expanding man’s horizons. The future doesn’t belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we’ll continue to follow them.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinton was known for his feel-your-pain persona, on display after the Oklahoma City bombing. “You have lost too much, but you have not lost everything," he said. "And you have certainly not lost America, for we will stand with you for as many tomorrows as it takes.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>After the killing of congregants at Mother Emanuel church in Charleston, South Carolina, Obama sang the hymn “Amazing Grace” and also challenged the nation. “At some point," he said, "we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency. And it is in our power to do something about it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Unlike Trump, Biden was unsparing in his remarks after the insurrection at the Capitol about where blame lay. “They weren’t protesters," Biden said. “Don’t dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob, insurrectionists, domestic terrorists. It’s that basic. It’s that simple.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9912411980">Full Coverage: Politics\u003c/div>\u003cp>But Biden also promised a better day ahead, saying that the rioters did not represent the “true America.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Oratory in such times, just by being composed at a time when things are falling apart, reassures and opens a door for positive responses and for hope,” Fields said. “Ironically, in being spoken to we can be reassured that we are being heard, that the fears and emotions we have been too distressed to compose, can be articulated, can be expressed.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most times, presidents themselves don’t write the words that are most remembered, but their speechwriters know their voice and sentiments. Obama and Clinton heavily edited their speeches; Lincoln wrote many of his own. The most memorable words from Trump\'s inaugural address were about the need to end an “American carnage” that existed mostly in his own mind.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Soon, Biden’s words will be the ones the nation examines. He has a mixed history with oratory. His first presidential campaign ended largely because he appropriated language from a British politician, Neil Kinnock, a literary theft that today seems almost benign. But Biden even then, in 1987, was also known for his ability to use words, albeit sometimes too many of them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The president-elect is fond of both lofty rhetoric spoken with an eye to history and the common language of the union hall. He will need to summon both in the days ahead, navigating the fractious end to the Trump presidency and imploring the nation to turn the page.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The word crisis has its origins in the Greek language. Loosely translated, it means the stage of a disease where one lives or dies. It can be overused in the modern context, but few would argue the American democracy is not facing one. The challenge for crisis oratory is to not underplay the severity of the problem or foster a new sense of panic. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The most effective oratory has, at its core, a sense of authenticity, which plays to Biden’s strength.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Words matter. Words can explain, inspire, console, and heal. In the past, presidents have tried to do these things, with various degrees of success,” said John J. Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College, adding: “Trump is unique in that he has made things much worse.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Tuesday, as he was leaving for an event to boast about wall construction at the Mexican border, Trump had another chance to soothe the public. He chose instead to focus on blaming others.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This impeachment is causing tremendous anger, as you’re doing it, and it’s really a terrible thing that they’re doing,” Trump said. "For Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, to continue on this path. I think it’s causing tremendous danger to our country, and it’s causing tremendous anger. I want no violence. Thank you.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Michael Tackett, deputy Washington bureau chief for The Associated Press, has been covering politics and government since 1986.

                        '\u003cp>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi hoisted a new state flag without the Confederate battle emblem on Monday, just over six months after legislators retired the last state banner in the U.S. that included the divisive rebel symbol.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The new flag has a magnolia and the phrase, “In God We Trust.” Voters approved the design in November, and Gov. Tate Reeves on Monday signed a law to make it an official state symbol.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“A new chapter in our history begins today,” one of the leaders in changing the flag, Republican House Speaker Philip Gunn, told more than 100 people who gathered in near-freezing weather to watch the new flag being raised outside the state Capitol.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Just before signing the law, Reeves said the old flag with the Confederate symbol was “a prominent roadblock to unity.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“When many looked at our former flag, they just saw a symbol of the state and heritage they love. But many felt dismissed, diminished and even hated because of that flag,” Reeves said. “That is not a firm foundation for our state. So today, we turn the page.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Momentum to \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/1d4969cb533fb6ab7fe381fb5855c256">change \u003c/a> the Mississippi flag built quickly in June as protests against racial injustice were happening across the nation. Legislators created a commission to design a new flag, specifying that the banner could not include Confederate imagery and that it must include “In God We Trust.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\'70f17a4221664fdfae28c1e3e55b1fda\' class=\'media-placeholder\'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Reeves previously served as lieutenant governor, and he had said for years that if the old flag were to change, it should only be done by a statewide vote. He signed the bill retiring the old flag after legislators passed it by a veto-proof margin.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The public submitted more than 3,000 design proposals, and the commission chose one that has a magnolia blossom encircled by white stars representing Mississippi as the 20th state, plus a single gold star representing Native Americans. The gold star is made of diamond shapes that are significant to the Choctaw culture. The flag also has gold stripes representing the artistic heritage of state that has produced blues great B.B. King, and Nobel Prize-winning novelist William Faulkner.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The law retiring the old flag also specified that the commission\'s proposed new flag would go on the Nov. 3 ballot for a yes-or-no vote. The magnolia design was the only flag proposal on the ballot, and more than 71% of people who voted that day said yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reeves said Monday of the new flag: “It is one small effort to unify, but it is done in good faith.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Confederate battle emblem — a red field topped by a blue X with 13 white stars — was put on the upper left corner of the Mississippi flag in 1894 by white supremacists in the state Legislature a generation after the South lost the Civil War. The flag was part of the backlash against political power that Black people had attained during Reconstruction. Critics had long said the flag was a racist symbol that failed to represent a state with the largest percentage of Black residents in the nation. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups have waved the Confederate battle flag for decades. Georgia put the battle emblem prominently on its state flag in 1956, during a backlash to the civil rights movement, and that state removed the symbol from its banner in 2001.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mississippi voters chose to keep the Confederate-themed flag during a 2001 election, but all of the state\'s public universities and several cities and counties stopped flying it in recent years. Several took it down after the June 2015 slayings of nine Black worshippers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. The white man charged in the shooting deaths had previously posed, in photos published online, holding the Confederate battle flag.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Democratic former Gov. Ronnie Musgrove attended the bill signing Monday and said of the new flag: “It has emblems and a design that everyone can support.” Musgrove was in office during the 2001 election, and he advocated removing the Confederate battle emblem then. He lost his bid for reelection in 2003 when opponents put up signs with the slogan: “Keep the Flag. Change the Governor.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Supporters of the Confederate-themed Mississippi flag are starting an initiative that seeks to put four flag designs on the statewide ballot for another vote — the 1894 flag, the magnolia flag, one designed by a Jackson artist as an alternative to the 1894 flag and one designed for the state\'s 2017 bicentennial. Getting that on the ballot is a long shot, though, because of the signature-gathering process that is made more challenging by the coronavirus pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A few dozen people demonstrated on the south steps of the Mississippi Capitol in support of reviving the old flag. Some also carried flags supporting President Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow Emily Wagster Pettus on Twitter at \u003ca href="http://twitter.com/EWagsterPettus">http://twitter.com/EWagsterPettus\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>',

(AP) — California is transforming baseball stadiums, fairgrounds and even a Disneyland Resort parking lot into mass vaccination sites as the coronavirus surge overwhelms hospitals and sets a deadly new record in the state.\u003c/p>\u003cp>California\'s COVID-19 death toll reached 30,000 on Monday, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It took six months for the nation\'s most populous state to reach 10,000 deaths but barely a month to jump from 20,000 to 30,000 deaths. California ranks third nationally for COVID-19-related deaths, behind Texas and New York, which is No. 1 with nearly 40,000. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Public health officials have estimated about 12% of those who catch the virus will require hospital care, usually several weeks after infection as they get sicker.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gov. Gavin Newsom and public health officials are counting on widespread vaccinations to help stem the tide of new infections, starting with medical workers and the most vulnerable elderly, such as those in care homes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Newsom, a Democrat, acknowledged the rollout of vaccines has been too slow and he pledged 1 million shots will be administered this week, more than twice what’s been done so far. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That effort will require what Newsom called an “all-hands-on-deck approach,” including having vaccinations dispensed by pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, dentists, paramedics and emergency medical technicians, and members of the California National Guard.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Orange County, south of Los Angeles County, announced Monday that its first mass vaccination site will be at a Disneyland Resort parking lot in Anaheim. It\'s one of five sites to be set up to vaccinate thousands of people daily.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The sites are “absolutely critical in stopping this deadly virus," county Supervisor Doug Chaffee said in a statement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The state will vastly expand its effort with new mass vaccination sites at parking lots for Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Petco Park in San Diego and the CalExpo fairgrounds in Sacramento. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Cars lined up early Monday near the downtown stadium in San Diego, where officials aimed to inoculate 5,000 health care workers daily.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s kind of like a Disneyland ride” with cars moving through, said Heather Buschman, spokeswoman for UC San Diego Health, whose medical staff was administering the shots. \u003c/p>\u003cp>She said people seemed eager to be vaccinated, with more than 12,500 health care workers in San Diego County initially scheduling appointments. \u003c/p>\u003cp>By week\'s end, the city of Los Angeles planned to convert its huge COVID-19 testing site at Dodger Stadium into a vaccination center to handle 12,000 inoculations daily.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Los Angeles County is an epicenter for the COVID-19 outbreak, accounting for some 40% of California\'s virus-related deaths and a huge number of new cases.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Monday, nearly 8,000 people were hospitalized in Los Angeles County, which had fewer than 50 intensive care units available in an area with a population of 10 million people, said Dr. Christina Ghaly, county director of Health Services.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While the county saw a dip in new cases, the director of public health, Barbara Ferrer, said that probably is due to decreased testing after the New Year\'s holiday. She predicted another increase in cases from people who gathered together unsafely over the holiday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ferrer also said COVID-19 is still killing someone in the county every eight minutes, on average.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There is a sliver of hope, with new hospitalizations statewide down from about 3,500 a day earlier this month to about 2,500. Some forecasts have predicted the hospitalizations will level off by the end of the month.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Yet recent frightening jumps in new positive cases show the state may simply have bought itself time to prepare for what officials still expect to be a “surge on top of a surge” in the next few weeks driven by New Year\'s celebrations, officials said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, the state may get “a little breathing room” for hospitals with staff and oxygen supplies stretched thin, and for 1,000 newly arriving contract medical workers to be augmented by another 1,000 or so before the surge peaks, said Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Lawmakers also continued to plead with people to keep social distancing to slow the spread of infection. In Los Angeles County, residents were being urged to wear masks even when at home if they go outside regularly and live with someone elderly or otherwise at high risk.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Dying from COVID in the hospital means dying alone,” county Board of Supervisors Chair Hilda Solis said. “Visitors are not allowed into hospitals for their own safety. Families are sharing their final goodbyes on tablets and mobile phones."\u003c/p>\u003cp>“One of the more heartbreaking conversations that our health care workers share is about these last words when children apologize to their parents and grandparents for bringing COVID into their homes, for getting them sick," Solis said. “And these apologies are just some of the last words that loved ones will ever hear."\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Watson reported from San Diego. Associated Press writers John Antczak, Robert Jablon and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\u003c/p>',

                        '\u003cp>LONDON (AP) — Social media platforms are continuing to crack down on fringe groups and conspiracy theories following last week’s deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Twitter suspended more than 70,000 accounts associated with the far right QAnon conspiracy and Facebook is removing posts and content fraudulently claiming that the U.S. election was stolen as social media companies scramble to rein in harmful activity ahead of the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Twitter said Tuesday that given the events last week in Washington, D.C., where a mob of pro-Trump loyalists tried to violently storm the Capitol building, it was taking action against online behavior “that has the potential to lead to offline harm.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In many cases, a single individual operated numerous accounts, driving up the total number of affected accounts, the company \u003ca href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/protecting--the-conversation-following-the-riots-in-washington--.html">said in a blog post. \u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>“These accounts were engaged in sharing harmful QAnon-associated content at scale and were primarily dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service,” the company said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Twitter’s sweeping purge of QAnon accounts, which began Friday, is part of a crackdown that also includes its decision to ban President Donald Trump from the service over worries about further incitement to violence. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The suspensions mean some Twitter users will lose followers, in some cases by the thousands, the company said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The QAnon conspiracy theory is centered on the baseless belief that Trump is waging a secret campaign against “deep state” enemies and a child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals. Twitter has been trying to rein in QAnon for months, removing more than 7,000 accounts in July.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Twitter\'s suspensions followed a flurry of actions by tech giants that silenced rival social media platform Parler, a magnet for the far right. Apple and Google removed Parler from their app stores late last week and Amazon took it offline Monday when it stopped providing it with web-hosting services, citing Parler\'s failure to remove a surge of dangerous content “that encourages and incites violence against others.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Parler has sued to get back online, arguing in a federal court Monday that Amazon was abusing its market power in a way that “will kill Parler’s business — at the very time it is set to skyrocket.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Twitter said it’s also stepping up enforcement measures and starting Tuesday it will limit the spread of posts that violate its civic integrity policy by preventing anyone from replying to, liking or retweeting them. The policy prohibits attempts to manipulate elections and spread misleading info about their results, with repeated violations resulting in permanent suspension. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Facebook said late Monday that it will begin removing from its Facebook and Instagram platforms any content containing the phrase “stop the steal." Trump and his supporters have deployed the phrase to push false claims of voting fraud. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Facebook said that it is still allowing “robust conversations" about the election\'s outcome. “But with continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the US presidential election that can lead to violence, and use of the term by those involved in Wednesday’s violence in DC, we’re taking this additional step in the lead up to the inauguration,” executives \u003ca href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/preparing-for-inauguration-day/">said in a blog post\u003c/a>. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The company said it may take some time to “scale up" the new enforcement measure but it has already removed a “significant number of posts," without giving a specific number. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>For all of AP’s tech coverage, visit \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/hub/technology">https://apnews.com/apf-technology\u003c/a>\u003c/p>',

                        '\u003cp>LONDON (AP) — The coronavirus pandemic has forced television hospital shows to confront a key question — could the biggest medical crisis in recent decades be ignored in favor of escapism for viewers?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Medical shows have reached different conclusions, but Fox\'s “The Resident” opted to address the pandemic right away in its fourth season debut Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Dr. Daniela Lamas, who works in critical care at Boston\'s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, also writes “The Resident." She said pretending the pandemic never happened was discussed in the summer, but ultimately dismissed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The question was, will people have the stomach for this in January? And the answer to that question was, we don’t know," she said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Whether they do or they don’t, we can’t in good faith, as a medical show that claims to have some degree of medical veracity, we can’t ignore the greatest public health crisis of our time. And we can’t expect people to see our characters and believe in them if these fictional health care providers have not experienced what real health care providers have in this fictional world.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The show, which stars Matt Czuchry, Emily VanCamp and Manish Dayal, takes a thriller perspective on diagnosing medical mysteries and healthcare corruption at Chastain Memorial, a fictional hospital in Atlanta.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\'9d9ff1ea8d8d45a1a847123f39a6d21c\' class=\'media-placeholder\'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Other U.S. medical dramas, "The Good Doctor,” “Chicago Med” and “Grey’s Anatomy," have focused on the pandemic’s impact on healthcare workers this season. On “Grey\'s,” main character Meredith Grey is in critical care fighting the virus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The goal — and presumably it’s one shared by a lot of television shows — which is, what can we show people that they might not know otherwise?” explains Lamas.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="related-story-embed" id="e1a5f490-2e30-11eb-e20d-1146a81e8fed">\u003c/div>\u003cp>"The Resident,” like its contemporaries, includes storylines which highlight the virus’ disproportionate impact on communities of color, people who can’t afford to isolate and the importance of masks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There are issues that that come up in terms of money, in terms of resource, in terms of PPE, that that also fit well in the kind of wheelhouse of our show,” said Lamas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The Resident” was among the productions that donated to real healthcare workers the masks that would have been used as to be used as props and continues to use lower grade masks on the program to avoid using up supplies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>They also let go of the drama provided by the last-minute corridor dash for surgical intervention, which often provides an episode’s life or death tension.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“People were wondering, can we take somebody for a big surgery? And I mean, sure we could. But does that reflect the real story? COVID is so much about waiting. It’s so much about decisions around intubation. It’s so much about isolation. And so I think really being willing to tell that story, instead of the big surgery, alarms blaring, recovery story was something that that we had to get into as well.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Unlike “Grey’s Anatomy,” “The Resident” won’t keep the coronavirus front and center after the opening episode, to provide some relief from the present.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think ‘Grey’s’ does that through their beach. I think that’s their escapism and I like that,” said Lamas of the dreamlike sequences experienced by Ellen Pompeo\'s Meredith during her illness.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There are COVID stories that we could have for a season beyond. But I think that the need, the desire to give people both the grounding in medical reality and then the escapism, the entertainment and, ultimately, the hope that this isn’t forever.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="media-placeholder" id="36a2a12f4833428f8b1d22bd209101a4">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“COVID is always going to be a presence with us throughout the course of season four but we hope it’s not something that’s going to overwhelm the audience and we can find something that is a balance between the two and something that’s cathartic and joyful and hopeful,” said Matt Czuchry, who plays Dr. Conrad Hawkins on the show.\u003c/p>\u003cp>"Just as simple as not seeing us with masks on the whole time is hopefully something that says, ‘Hey, we can get there. You know, we can get past this; we can get through this.’ But in order to be able to say that, we have to address the reality of the situation, which is incredibly difficult and traumatic for so many, so many people.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>ABC’s “The Good Doctor,” starring Freddie Highmore, had two episodes called “Frontline” where the characters took on COVID-19, before moving into a post-pandemic world.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="hub-link-embed" id="afs:Content:9913958612">Full Coverage: Entertainment\u003c/div>\u003cp>“The Resident” takes a similar approach. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The season opener flashes back to the personal and political impact of the virus on Chastain Memorial — before placing Hawkins, Nurse Practioner Nic Nevins and Dr. Devon Pravesh into a safer future.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The pandemic\'s fallout will still affect the characters, but the crisis is over.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It could give real medical staff a glimpse of what their future holds if, like Lamas, they avidly follow hospital shows.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m probably the minority in that I do not miss an episode of medical dramas,” she said. “A lot of the nurses in the medical ICU watch ‘The Resident.’ We chat about ‘Grey’s.’”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“For many people, it is the way they see hospitals, people who have the good fortune not to see hospitals through themselves or their family. And for those of us who work in the hospital, there is something powerful about seeing this sort of escapism type of version of our reality on television.”\u003c/p>',

Schools remained closed in Madrid and much of central Spain, and 11 of the country\'s 51 provinces and autonomous regions were at the highest weather alert level. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The town of Bello, in the northeastern Teruel province, registered a temperature of minus 25.4 degrees Celsius (minus 13.7 F), and the town of Molina de Aragón, in the central Guadalajara province, was only a tenth of a degree warmer. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In Madrid and the capital\'s surrounding region, home to 6.6 million people, thermometers plummeted to up to minus 16 degrees Celsius (3.2 F). However, the day turned out to be sunny, offering some relief to people trying to get to work and the emergency and military crews working to reopen roads, reestablish power lines and to ensure the distribution of food and coronavirus vaccines.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Authorities urged people to stay at home unless absolutely necessary to prevent accidents that could further strain hospital emergency rooms. A military hospital in the capital saw a worrying uptick in trauma cases, Defense Minister Margarita Robles said late Monday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Visiting the operation center of a military emergency unit, Spanish Prime Minister Spanish Pedro Sánchez thanked civil protection crews and soldiers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have had to live difficult and complex times, but we will move forward because the Spanish society does not give up in the face of adversity,” he said in televised comments.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Storm Filomena left up to half a meter (20 inches) of snow across large swaths of Spain over a 30-hour period that started Friday morning. Five people, including two homeless people in Barcelona, died as a result of the blizzard and the ensuing cold snap, the government reported.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Madrid regional government said Tuesday it was still waiting for a new batch of 48,750 Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine doses that had been due to arrive the day before by plane but had to be diverted to a northern Spanish airport. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The regional health department told The Associated Press that the delay was not expected to affect the local vaccine drive, which continued at nursing homes and among health personnel with doses delivered earlier. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>At the headquarters of SUMMA 112, the Madrid emergency service, a makeshift vaccination center was created in a warehouse basement to administer jabs to some 1,500 employees.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is s very important for the world\'s population that we all get vaccinated to end this pandemic," said Pedro Lara, an ambulance technician who got his first dose Tuesday. “It\'s the only way to end it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The capital’s airport, the busiest in the country, was expected to get back to full operation on Tuesday. Trains were steadily increasing in frequency, although Madrid’s subway and commuter trains were dangerously overcrowded.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a preliminary assessment, Madrid City Hall estimated that at least 150,000 of the city’s 800,000 trees fell from the weight of unfamiliar snow.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Madrid’s main retail market reopened Tuesday for the first time since Friday, leading to frantic activity of trucks and vans delivering the fresh produce that had been in short supply at supermarkets.\u003c/p>\u003cp>__\u003c/p>\u003cp>Iain Sullivan and Alicia León contributed to this report.\u003c/p>',

                        '\u003cp>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Europe\'s push into electric cars is gathering speed — despite the pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Automaker Volkswagen tripled sales of battery-only cars in 2020 as its new electric compact ID.3 came on the market ahead of tough new European Union limits on auto emissions. And Germany, long a laggard in adopting electric vehicles, saw more people buy electrics in December than opted for previously dominant diesel vehicles. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Those are early signs of what will likely be an upcoming year of increasing market share for electric cars as EU regulations drive their adoption, despite the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic that has caused the overall car market to shrink.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Volkswagen said Tuesday its namesake brand sold 134,000 battery-powered cars last year, up from 45,000 in 2019. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class="ad-placeholder">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Including hybrids, which combine an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, sales of electrified cars reached 212,000, up from 82,000 in 2019.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Volkswagen\'s \u003ca href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-brand-triples-deliveries-of-all-electric-vehicles-in-2020-6751">announcement \u003c/a> comes as the auto industry association in Germany reports that one in four cars sold in the country in December had an electric motor, uptake that was supported by incentives as part of the government stimulus package during the COVID-19 recession. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Battery and hybrid cars took 26.6% of sales that month, running ahead of diesel cars, which had 26.2%. That is also a token of diesel\'s steep decline after Volkswagen\'s 2015 scandal involving diesel cars rigged to cheat on emissions tests.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Electric cars have so far been a small but rapidly growing slice of the European market. According to \u003ca href="https://www.acea.be/press-releases/article/fuel-types-of-new-cars-petrol-47.5-hybrids-12.4-electric-9.9-market-share-t"> the European Automobile Manufacturers Association,\u003c/a> in the July-September quarter of 2020 9.9% of cars sold were chargeable vehicles, up from 3.0% a year earlier. The association publishes full-year statistics on Feb. 4. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Automakers in the EU must sell more zero-emission cars in order to meet tougher fleet average limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas blamed for climate change. Those limits came fully into effect on Jan. 1. Failure to achieve a fleet average of less than 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer driven can mean heavy fines. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sales have been driven by government incentives, and by an increasing number of new models that — like the ID.3 — were designed purely as electric cars, rather than being converted from internal combustion models. Electric-only design can mean more interior space as a selling point. The compact ID.3 isn\'t coming to the U.S. market, where Volkswagen will offer the electric \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-technology-environment-germany-ralf-1f4c9b2bb008264d92b1ec30e060d5cd">ID.4 sport-utility vehicle\u003c/a> made on the same mechanical base.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Demand has been held back by lack of places to charge electric cars, including for people who live in apartment buildings and can\'t install a charging box at home. Germany\'s auto association, the VDA, said there\'s only one publicly available charging station for every 17 electric cars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>California-based Tesla has been a major factor in the electric upswing with its Model 3 and its proprietary network of fast-charging stations. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The government in China, the world\'s largest auto market, is also pressing carmakers to lower emissions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The uptake of electric vehicles has been slower in the United States, where regulatory pressure has been weaker and where gasoline costs as little as $2 per gallon, depending on the region. That compares to 1.30 euros per liter of gas, or $6 per gallon in Germany, much of which is taxes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Read all AP stories about climate change issues at \u003ca href="https://apnews.com/hub/Climate">https://apnews.com/hub/Climate.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>',

                "\u003cp>FILE - In this April 10, 1912 file photo the Titanic leaves Southampton, England on her maiden voyage. The U.S. government will try to stop a company's planned salvage mission to retrieve the Titanic’s wireless telegraph machine, arguing the expedition would break federal law and a pact with Britain to leave the iconic shipwreck undisturbed. U.S. attorneys filed a legal challenge before a federal judge in Norfolk, Va, late Monday, June 8, 2020. The expedition is expected to occur by the end of August. (AP Photo/File)\u003c/p>",
